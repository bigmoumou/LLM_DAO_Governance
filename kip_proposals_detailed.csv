KIP-1: Introduce BCT Bonds,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/QmTvD4PzBCDABipuJvAkYKDBVaVmkN2aFA7aWWdBatzjp4,"KIP-1: Introduce BCT Bonds
Summary:
Introduce BCT bonds as a more efficient way of accumulating BCT for the Treasury, increasing demand for BCT, a core goal for the protocol.
Background:
KlimaDAO has seen unprecedented demand since launch, attracting over 30,000 discord members and 13,000 KLIMA holders in a matter of days. Our plan was to launch with liquidity bonds only, bootstrapping the liquidity to sufficient levels before introducing BCT bonds. Since then, we have amassed over 34 million dollars in liquidity, split between the BCT/USDC and KLIMA/BCT pools. We believe now is the time to introduce BCT bonds as another method of absorbing carbon tonnage into the Treasury.
Abstract:
We’ve seen a massive on-boarding of BCTs on-chain. For reference, we expected 2 million to be on-boarded on day one, but we’ve seen over 6.6 million minted so far, with more coming every day.
Those who bridge BCTs on-chain have four options:
Buy KLIMA for BCTs (increasing the premium of KLIMA);
Sell BCTs for USDC (decreasing the BCT premium);
Create KLIMA/BCT SLP, bond it into the Treasury (increasing the KLIMA premium and adding liquidity); or
Create BCT/USDC SLP, bond it into the Treasury (decreasing the BCT premium and adding liquidity).
BCT bonds add an additional option for users and carbon bridgers to utilize their on-chain carbon offsets and get exposure to KLIMA without being affected by slippage.
Additionally, BCT bonds increase Treasury reserves much more efficiently compared to LP bonds. Currently, for KLIMA/BCT liquidity, only 1/20th can be used for backing (based on the Risk-Free Value formula). With BCT bonds, for every 1 BCT bonded, the Treasury receives 1 BCT for backing. This allows us to bolster the Treasury more efficiently, extend the runway, and provide a floor upon which KLIMA can build.
Motivation:
Capture BCT for the Treasury via BCT bonds, increasing runway, increasing demand for BCT, and encouraging further development of carbon offsets off-chain and bridging of such offsets on-chain.
Other:
The policy team reserves the ability to adjust bond parameters as needed to achieve a balance between liquidity and reserve inflows to the Treasury.
The code is written, tested, and ready to be published.
Since this is a time sensitive KIP, the vote will be open for 24 hours. If approved, BCT bonds will launch at 0400 UTC on Friday October 22, 2021.",24,"[""For: Add BCT Bonds\n64.5k\n99.7%"", ""Against: Do not add BCT Bonds\n193.705\n0.3%""]"
KIP-2 KlimaDAO Bug Bounty,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x9df154d1531aabcc2ed7258833c18e0c39d6f527394b387233a63ff3eabdb010,"Summary
This proposal authorizes KlimaDAO to offer a bug-bounty for disclosed bugs, exploits, and vulnerabilities which meet the later specified criteria.
The rewards for this bounty will include a ""Proof of Whitehat"" NFT reward and a cash bonus paid in KLIMA for whitehats that identify bugs that could lead to a loss of funds from the Protocol's Treasury and Bonding contracts.
The DAO will fund the reward using KLIMA from DAO funds.
This KIP is for the first bug bounty programme from KlimaDAO to incentivise early action in this regard and minimize risk for the protocol.
Motivation
KlimaDAO must ensure that it is safe and secure. Incentivising whitehats to search for bugs and exploits through rewards is one proactive strategy to identify and rectify weaknesses in the protocol.
Ultimately, an effective bug bounty programme can save the protocol time and money and ensure it is resilient to enable long-term growth.
Proposal
The bug bounty paid out will be equivalent to 50% of the funds which could have been stolen from an exploit, up to a maximum cash value of $2,500,000.
The bug bounty will only be paid out for submissions that satisfy the eligibility criteria, outlined below.
Source of Funds for Bug Bounty
If approved, the protocol will ring-fence 10% of DAO funds for the bug bounty programme. If additional funds are required, they will be sourced from the DAO’s general funds.
This approach gives the DAO an immediate budget to compensate whitehats. It also builds up an additional budget that may be allocated for further security incentives in the future as the protocol grows.
Process
Bug bounties should be emailed to bounty@klimadao.finance
Klimadmins/Core members will evaluate the threat immediately and prioritise taking action to minimise the risk of the exploit.
The evaluation will be used to validate the proportion of the funds at risk from the exploit, and determine the total bug bounty payout.
To be eligible for the bounty, whitehats must satisfy the eligibility criteria, below.
Eligibility
To qualify under the rewards programme, whitehats must:
Be the first to report a specific vulnerability.
Send a clear textual description of the report along with steps to reproduce the vulnerability. Attachments such as screenshots or proof of concept code should be included as necessary.
Disclose the vulnerability report responsibly to us. Public disclosure or disclosure to other third parties - including vulnerability brokers - before we addressed your report forfeit the reward.
Demonstrate care in reproducing the vulnerability. In particular, test only on accounts you own and do not attempt to view or tamper with data belonging to others.
Not submit vulnerabilities based on information they were not able to garner for themselves. For example an exploit which “would work if a hacker could compromise an admin key” will not be considered.
Other Details
Any details which are not explicitly outlined in this post, but which must be decided upon in order to execute the Bug Bounty program (including but not limited to who is commissioned to create the NFT, etc.) shall be decided by the Core member managing the bug bounty.",823,"[""YES: I agree, create the program\n39.9k\n99.78%"", ""NO: I disagree, don't create\n89.267\n0.22%""]"
KIP-3 Introduce Policy Framework,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xbe5ba88701e09fad2548ec2aca539b23cc04a5b7bc1961397fc98a0a303c5249,"Summary:
Introduce the initial policy state of KlimaDAO and a reward rate framework to guide Policy decisions and align expectations for the community. Reduce the reward rate from 0.5% to 0.46% (22k APY%).
Motivation:
When KlimaDAO first launched, we had a reward rate of 0.5%, which equates to a WPY (Weekly Percentage Yield) of 8.54%, and an APY of 37-38k%. To incentivize people to join the KLIMA ecosystem, a high APY was necessary in order to attract people to invest in the protocol in its infancy.
Since then, we’ve obtained 11.3m BCT in the treasury, with a risk free value of 2.3m. We’ve also increased our liquidity pools from 13m to 137m. We’ve opened up the DAO, so that anyone can start contributing. Policy itself is made up largely of regular contributors that aren’t part of the core team, making many of the bonding parameter decisions seen to date.
To become a carbon-backed reserve currency, two goals must be met: (1) a large supply to facilitate transactions, and (2) a large treasury in order to back each token, ensuring stability and confidence in the protocol. Our goal is to increase KLIMA’s supply over the long run and, through integrations and mass adoption, become a decentralized reserve currency backed by carbon offsets.
While expansion of the supply is one of the long term goals of KlimaDAO, doing so too quickly would be detrimental to our ability to generate revenue through bonding. In addition, as the supply increases exponentially, so does the revenue needed to maintain metrics such as the RFV/KLIMA. The Policy team must balance two types of supply emissions to ensure the long-term success of the protocol: the emissions from staking rewards and the emissions from bonding. Staking reward emissions form the majority of our supply growth, while the bonding emissions depend on many factors such as total supply, demand, and bond capacity variables set by the Policy team. While the Policy team has been actively managing the supply growth through bonding, we believe it’s time to (1) make the first adjustment to manage the supply growth occurring through staking rewards and (2) establish a framework for future adjustments to the same.
Proposal:
We propose a framework below, which gives the total supply of KLIMA, paired with the range of APY percentage we expect. Since staking reward emissions scale directly with total supply, it makes sense to base the reward rate itself off of total supply thresholds. We’ve also indicated what phase we think that the Klima protocol is in when we’re within these ranges:
Discovery (Seed)
1 - 1,000,000 KLIMA -> 50,000% - 20,000% APY
Integrations (Sprout)
1,000,000 - 10,000,000 KLIMA -> 30,000% - 2,000% APY
Adoption (Sapling)
10,000,000 - 100,000,000 KLIMA -> 3,000% - 200% APY
Stabilization (Adult)
100,000,000 - 1,000,000,000 KLIMA -> 300% - 20% APY
Maturity (Elder)
1B-100B KLIMA -> 30% - 5% APY
Brief Explanation of each phase:
Discovery: Protocol is very much in its infancy, with a single goal in mind: survive and prove itself. At this phase, we’re very isolated, with no integrations, and focused on growth.
Integrations: Protocol has reached steady state, metrics are in a healthy range, and we’ve grown enough for other projects to start integrating with us. Growth is still a focus.
Adoption: At this point, the protocol has grown significantly, with many integrations, partnerships, and protocols building on top of us. At this point, people will start to use KLIMA as the go-to carbon currency, for companies to utilize to prove their commitment to sustainability.
Stabilization: Most of the growth has been realized at this point. Mass adoption and stability have been achieved. At this point, most of the efforts are focused on stabilization, to ensure that KLIMA remains in widespread use and becomes a unit-of-account.
Maturity: The protocol has reached a state where stability is no longer a concern. At this stage, KLIMA becomes the symbol of fighting climate change and is synonymous with Carbon Credits, Sustainability, and Zero Emissions for countries.
It’s critical to note that this is a FRAMEWORK AND GUIDELINE, and should be treated as such. All reward rate changes will still go through standard governance and will require a vote. This is simply to align the expectations of the Klimates with those of the Policy team.",1,"[""Accept the Reward Framework\n72.8k\n97.96%"", ""Decline the Reward Framework\n1.5k\n2.04%""]"
KIP-4: Introduce wsKLIMA/gOHM bonds,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x554482501e69eb4da3fcb6c98de54b932e87bd635319224765a5c495d4be7f0f,"Summary:
Introduce wsKLIMA/gOHM bonds in order to participate in Olympus’s proteus program. Use DAO funds in order to bootstrap a sizable wsKLIMA/gOHM pool on day 1.
Background:
KlimaDAO is a fork of OlympusDAO, utilizing the bonding mechanism in order to acquire BCTs (Base Carbon Tonnes) into our treasury, creating demand for carbon credits, and facilitating a market for them. We could have not been successful without the assistance of Olympus, and are always thankful for them.
We want to continue providing support and assisting Olympus in establishing liquidity rails onto other networks. Olympus has recently released a proposal to bootstrap liquidity on other networks by providing liquidity mining rewards: OIP-45 . We’d like to participate in the Proteus program, benefiting both parties and strengthening our relationship.
Abstract:
Olympus aims to become the decentralized reserve currency of DeFi. In order to fulfill this goal, robust liquidity rails must be developed on not only their native chain (Ethereum), but on all major chains, such as polygon. As many of the team and community are long-time Ohmies, we truly believe that Olympus will achieve this goal. Therefore, we want to align ourselves to fully embrace the Olympus ecosystem.
Proposal:
Create a wsKLIMA/gOHM bond for KLIMA, incentivizing gOHM to be bridged into polygon, as well as creating liquidity for both Olympus and Klima. As gOHM is not a carbon asset, we cannot use it for backing. However, the addition of a new rail of liquidity, and the demand from ohmies to bond vastly outweighs any downside
Use 5 million in our treasury in order to bootstrap liquidity for the wsKLIMA/gOHM pool, once the 7- day MA of the Klima treasury has reached 10 million. This will be paired with $5m in gOHM, provided the proposal passes in Olympus (Note: If the proposal in Olympus fails, we will not be able to bootstrap this pool).
Divert a portion of the liquidity to acquire gOHM. This will be placed in our reserves, and will be diamond handed for the foreseeable future. We will work with the Olympus Policy and Treasury team to determine the rewards.",889,"[""Introduce wsKLIMA/gOHM bonds\n52.8k\n97.68%"", ""Don't do wsKLIMA/gOHM bonds\n1.3k\n2.32%""]"
KIP-5: Align APY,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x23ad83944ace8d3676cb44a8dadefe845c2db8a78ba7dd008eaa8d2a0bfb50e5,"Summary
We propose adjusting the reward rate to align the APY to the approved APY framework in KIP-3. This adjustment is necessary to correct for Polygon’s faster block times (leading to a 7.2 hr rebase instead of 8). In order to maintain the approved 22,000% target APY in KIP-3, the reward rate would be adjusted from 0.46 to 0.417%.
Motivation
See below for an explainer for the motivation and rationale behind KIP-5: https://klima-dao.notion.site/KIP-5-Explainer-959aab27dcf14e9ba9c01540fa70a1a7
See below for the community forum discussion regarding KIP-5: https://forum.klimadao.finance/d/4-kip-5-rebase-timing-and-apy-alignment
Proposal
Factoring in a rebase period of 7.25 hours per rebase, a resulting 1,200 epochs per year (rounded down to be conservative) can be utilized for the APY formula.
To achieve our target APY of approx 22,000%, the reward rate should be set to 0.417% (assuming 92.5% of KLIMA is staked).
This change would be made over an additional 25 epochs (8 days) after the conclusion of the change approved in KIP-3.
The Policy team will continue to monitor the block and rebase times to ensure the reward APYs are consistent with community approved APY targets, and propose additional adjustments if necessary.",1,"[""For: Reduce rate to match actual\n50.6k\n95.96%"", ""Against: Do not reduce rate\n2.1k\n4.04%""]"

Add MCO2 as the next reserve bond asset for KlimaDAO.
Proposal
We propose to have MCO2 reserve bonds as the next asset in Klima’s treasury. Because this asset is liquid enough on other platforms such as Coinbase and Gemini, there is less of a need for the bootstrapping of liquidity to come from us. Currently, there are already over 3 million MCO2 tokens available across Ethereum which can be easily bridged to Polygon via their official bridge.
To facilitate this joint partnership, the MOSS team will:
1.Bond 15k MCO2 into the treasury, and keep sKLIMA in their balance sheets.
2.Provide $1m (500k USDC and 50k MCO2) in MCO2/USDC liquidity to facilitate trading on polygon.
3.Provide $30,000 to KlimaDAO’s marketing team with the intent of collaborative marketing between us and MOSS.

KIP-8: Introduce KLIMA/USDC bonds,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xcc99da71fd0aa8dbffddff98cb5f5662193944cef9d604e91f265323c7ddedc8,"Motivation
Currently, the official KLIMA liquidity ecosystem is a simple 2 pool setup: USDC/BCT, and KLIMA/BCT. For most users, the most liquid route to swap USDC for KLIMA first swaps USDC for BCT, then BCT to KLIMA.
This system was initially made to bootstrap a robust BCT/USDC pool to incentivize users to bridge offsets on-chain via Toucan. We feel that this liquidity pool has been made large enough today, $50m in BCT/USDC. The utilization rate of this pool is consistently under 10%, which signals to the policy team that we have accomplished the goal of facilitating a carbon market for BCT in the short term.
At a high level, as we grow, we can expand liquidity vertically or horizontally. By developing KLIMA horizontally, we place KLIMA at the heart of the on-chain carbon economy. This benefits Klima as every trade in the on-chain offset market generates more volume through KLIMA, allowing the ecosystem to grow further by channeling demand and fees into the Klima treasury.
The benefits of a KLIMA/USDC pool are the it lowers fees for the end user, provides higher capital efficiency, and a better alignment of demand

Adjust reward rate to 0.312%, translating to a 6.2% 5 day ROI, and 8,000% APY, to align with policy priorities and expectations from the community, as well as ensure optimal protocol development.
Empower the Policy team to correct the reward rate when realized APY deviates significantly from the current target APY, ensuring alignment with expectations as laid out in KIP-3 and ongoing reward rate adjustment KIPs.
Proposal
In an effort to set proper expansion expectations and remain aligned with the framework approved in KIP-3, the Policy team proposes:
Adjusting the reward rate from 0.417% to 0.312% to an estimated 6.2% 5 day ROI or ~8000% APY.
This is equivalent to:
1.1) A 0.35% Daily Reduction.
1.2) A 1.87% Weekly Reduction.
1.3) 13 more days to double your sKLIMA balance.
Allow the Policy team to unilaterally execute minor reward rate corrections outlined by the following criteria:
Using the same calculation assumptions as the last approved KIP over the previous 7 day average:
10% APY deviation (e.g a target of 8000% APY would be adjusted if the current APY was 7200% or 8800% APY)
Any amount outside the target APY range for the current KIP-3 stage based on total supply. (e.g current APY of 4,000% when crossing into phase 3 at 10 million supply)

KIP-10: KlimaDAO Compensation Framework,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xa63e839bbde9160b779adcf53005d15a67c55b9174742e853711cf743834053a,"Summary:
The DAO would like to ask permission from the community to formalize the contributor compensation process and framework. This framework will be the guidelines in which the DAO can operate to pay its contributors, if any amendments are needed they must undergo another community vote.
To ensure the longevity of the protocol, increase liquidity initiatives and to help fund future projects the DAO would like to increase the treasury revenue gained from bonding from 10% up to 30%. Note, increasing the fee will not negatively impact staking or bonding.
Abstract:
The DAO has seen incredible growth in the amount of contributors since its inception. The protocol grew to an average market cap of over $100mm with over 80 contributors within 3 months of operation. Since then, the protocol has seen a contraction in market capitalization and with that a contraction in treasury KLIMA valuation. As stated in a recent Klima Medium Post, the DAO is focused on the continued development of the protocol. A formal framework is necessary to ensure fair and equitable compensation for sustained long-term growth and development.
Given the current market conditions, expected bond revenue, and amount of contributors within the DAO, the treasury only has a runway of approximately 3 months. This is based on the inflow of bonding revenue relative to the outflows from contributor allocations each month (assuming a price / Klima of $50). The DAO believes that continued contributor compensation is the best way to ensure protocol longevity and development.
The proposed framework has two key components to it:
Department leads will be given an option to move toward vested KLIMA to help mitigate selling pressure and to allow for more immediate compensation to regular contributors
Increase the amount of KLIMA that is distributed to the treasury to maintain current contribution levels
It is important to note that for every KLIMA that is minted for bonds, 0.1 KLIMA is minted for the DAO. For context, Olympus does 1 OHM for 1 KLIMA minted for the DAO. The DAO would like to increase this up to 0.3 KLIMA minted for 1 KLIMA minted for bonding. This extra KLIMA will be utilized for liquidity endeavors, contributor payout and any potential outsourcing of protocol work. The DAO treasury currently holds <30,000 KLIMA and the current payout per week to contributors is ~ 1.7k KLIMA.

KIP-11: TCO2 conversion,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xb6f70f84fbb0f5a24f67f73c30a7966af4f8e3572a2885011c6a0e705fb8178b,"Summary:
Allow KlimaDAO to redeem pooled carbon tonnes in the treasury into the underlying (BCT into an underlying TCO2 offset, for example), to convert into an equal or higher value carbon pool.
Motivation:
When new carbon pools are launched by Toucan or any protocol that uses the Toucan infrastructure, there may be overlap between one carbon pool and another. This allows anyone to redeem a TCO2 from one pool and deposit it into another. If the new carbon pool is on average higher quality than the original, the market should value that pool at a higher price, and thus moving offsets to a higher quality pool increases the market value of the same tonnage.
Proposal:
Allow the Policy team, advised by carbon experts in the DAO, to redeem a Toucan carbon pool token held in the treasury into its underlying TCO2, with the intent of depositing into another carbon pool. The restrictions are as follows:
The new carbon pool must not introduce new security risks to the treasury.
The quality requirements of the new carbon pool must be equal to or greater than the original carbon pool.
A maximum limit of 10% of the total carbon treasury can be redeemed at one time.
Full transparency reports after the conversion has been done, in order to ensure full communication to the users.

KIP-12: Inverse bonds,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xa72601fcee690c061a8bba6e717ee74db09f782eb3bbbefeaf27ce1e2dad0a35,"Summary:
Grant Policy the ability to create Inverse bonds as a tool in the policy team’s arsenal.
Motivation:
Klima aims to become a decentralized reserve currency for the carbon market. Through integrations, partnerships, and bootstrapping an entire new market on-chain, becoming the defacto currency utilized in the space. Klima is trading at a premium because of this.
The backing of Klima is composed of carbon assets, which assist in giving Klima a treasury to derive value from, and market operations that the Klima protocol does should aim to increase this backing. In order to do this, the policy team proposes to introduce inverse bonds.
Inverse bonds allow the protocol to acquire KLIMA from the open market by offering an asset in the treasury to the bonder.
This allows users to acquire assets in the treasury at a discount, reducing supply, increasing the intrinsic value of the protocol, and adding buy pressure to the token.
Additionally, regular bonding under backing is disadvantageous to the protocol. This proposal allows the protocol to retain operations under all market conditions.
Proposal:
Allow policy to create inverse bonds as an additional bond lever.
Allow inverse bonds to be enabled under market backing.

KIP-13: Redeem and Utilize 25% BCT/USDC LP,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xb81487aac681331c5b2244df47c46765ed5d5c8a2f9a2b583569557dbab11ed9,"Summary
Redeem a portion of BCT/USDC LP from the treasury to extend runway and better utilize capital.
Motivation
During the founding days, KlimaDAO required a robust BCT/USDC pool to maintain USDC->BCT->KLIMA roots into the treasury, as well as to provide the DAO with a steady stream of revenue.
As a reserve currency, KLIMA value and utility is maximized when transactions on the ReFi ecosystem are routed through KLIMA. As proposed in KIP-8 when KLIMA/USDC bonds were first introduced, the DAO looks to develop KLIMA horizontally, becoming a deep reservoir at the crossroads of the on-chain offset market.
With Klima/USDC, this provides a significant reduction in slippage for users, as it causes the user to not route and experience slippage twice by hopping USDC-BCT-KLIMA. With only a 1.4mm pool (2.3% of total liquidity) , it accounts for 30% of the total Klima volume. As more liquidity is added, we can expect to see more volume facilitated there.
Over the past two months, BCT/USDC pool growth has stagnated, while the volume passing through the pool has reduced. By repurposing a portion of the $45MM currently sitting in the pool, Klima will be able to utilize the underlying assets to better facilitate the market.
Proposal
Allow the policy team to disband 25% of BCT/USDC to utilize in other methods outlined above.

KIP-14: Resilience Mode,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x719a96c6ed896e239b5f60f245213ade7a546c3295b768f932daf43c3b2adf5e,"Summary
Revise KlimaDAO’s current token mechanisms to slow down supply growth and give time for the on chain carbon market to develop.
Reduce KlimaDAO reward rate substantially (1000% or 2000% apy) in order to facilitate the time needed.
Motivation
When KlimaDAO first launched, the high APYs were justified as the growth potential for the ReFi space was very high, and untapped. Since the treasury started with very little, it was feasible and necessary to double, triple, or 10x the treasury. The metrics of KlimaDAO’s first two to three months vindicate this approach.
Within the current landscape, however, the growth rate of KlimaDAO has significantly reduced. The total BCT supply has also stagnated.
Other protocols, such as Moss, GoddessDAO, and C3 are coming up in the ReFi space, and they stand to unlock further growth of ReFi. However, we need to be more conservative with our own growth, in order for these protocols to flourish. At the moment, KlimaDAO is the primary source of demand for on-chain carbon credits. Moving forwards, we need to work in tandem with our partners to develop this nascent market for long-term stability. This includes ensuring that a robust and mature supply side of the market is developed, and it requires us to tap into the latent demand for tokenized carbon tonnes within Web3 and beyond.
During this period of building resiliency into ReFi, the policy team carries the view that we need to reduce overall bond capacity significantly as currently the majority of bonds are simply recycling the value in our treasury, rather than gaining value outside of the treasury, mainly due to a lack of supply.
KlimaDAO’s policy team will focus on delivering a series of Office Hours and policy content to engage with and educate the community on the rationale and decision making processes for these changes:
This supply expansion change (APY) facilitates two things:
1)Allows for a fair and proportional distribution of new rewards to the users of the protocol, as well as expanding supply to the amount that a currency needs to facilitate trading.
2)Reduces the dilution that occurs to token holders from bonds.
If KIP-14 passes, a shift in approach will materialize. When the protocol was first introduced, we were aiming to rapidly grow KlimaDAO’s supply as we expected large demand for ReFi – in the first 3 months this did occur with around 15,000,000 tonnes of carbon making its way onto the blockchain and the majority of them becoming locked in the KlimaDAO treasury. However, we must take a step back and adjust our expectations to the market conditions we see today: we consider it prudent to curtail our supply growth rate (i.e., reduce our reward rate).
While we heavily take inspiration from OlympusDAO and their mechanics, our trajectory is different from theirs, and we are tied to conditions in the real-world carbon markets. We are creating a carbon currency for ReFi from the ground upwards; they are creating a currency for DeFi and are able to leverage the existing (and mature) systems.
Proposal
Reduce APY to around 1000% or 2000%, equating to a reward rate of 0.164% or 0.209% respectively.
For this vote, ranked choice voting will be implemented. All users will select a primary and secondary vote. In the event of a plurality, the choice with the fewest votes is eliminated.

• Support the launch of C3 as an ally of KlimaDAO, supporting each other to develop the new crypto carbon economy with KlimaDAO as its decentralized bank and reserve currency.
• Approve the longest vote locking of KlimaDAO’s vested C3 tokens to maximize governance rights and delegate C3 voting on behalf of KlimaDAO to the Policy team with appropriate consultation of the community until a proper voting mechanism is implemented.
Proposal
KlimaDAO hereby accepts endorsing C3 as an allied ReFi protocol as well as their proffered token grant and supportive efforts, and likewise returning KlimaDAO’s support for C3’s endeavors. As such, together KlimaDAO and C3 will collaborate in close synergy toward our shared mission to accelerate and democratize climate action by creating a robust on-chain market for carbon offsets.
C3 Governance Participation
In addition to collaborating with C3 as outlined above, if this proposal is approved, KlimaDAO’s Policy team, in coordination with KlimaDAO contributors from Core, Council, and Partnerships, will be temporarily delegated to participate in C3’s governance process and all votes, with informal ongoing consultation of the community. Accordingly, the concerned KlimaDAO contributors with ad hoc community input will fully utilize the treasury’s allocation of C3 tokens to vote in good faith for C3 governance proposals and gauges that contribute to the long-term success of the on-chain carbon market and KlimaDAO.
In a future KIP, we will propose a mechanism to decentralize control over the treasury’s C3 governance power. In the meantime, the Policy team will more substantively consult with the KlimaDAO community on any significant or potentially controversial C3 governance proposals.

KIP-16: Use pKlima to deepen KLIMA/USDC LP,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xf6c26e1519a017b48e5c9be812a3746eaf4e27872560068cb0e379339adb5e83,"Summary:
Deepen KLIMA/USDC LP by exercising some of the DAO's community allocation of pKLIMA and pairing it with USDC attained from disbanding BCT/USDC LP (KIP-13).
Motivation:
The community allocation of pKLIMA is an untapped strategic reserve that can fulfill key DAO initiatives requiring KLIMA, such as seeding new liquidity pools or bolstering existing pools. pKLIMA always needs to be paired with 1 BCT to mint 1 KLIMA, and is a versatile policy tool. we are now in a position to utilize after disbanding 25% of BCT/USDC per KIP-13.
As a reserve currency, KLIMA value and utility is maximized when transactions are routed through KLIMA. As discussed in KIP-8, the DAO looks to develop KLIMA horizontally, becoming the keystone asset at the crossroads of the on-chain carbon economy. In order to do this, KlimaDAO requires deep liquidity in its KLIMA/USDC pool as this pool forms the first leg of any relay from USD to carbon asset, through KLIMA.
More trades route through KLIMA/USDC as we continue to bolster the LP through bonding. For users looking to purchase KLIMA, this provides a significant reduction in slippage as the user avoids having to experience slippage twice when hopping through USDC-BCT-KLIMA. Further, as we continue to onboard additional carbon assets, depth of the KLIMA/BCT pool will benefit only users looking to trade BCT. On the other hand, depth in the KLIMA/USDC pool will benefit users looking to trade any carbon asset that KLIMA is paired with, which is a key element of KLIMA’s horizontal development. We now have an opportunity to take a small portion of the disbanded BCT/USDC to quicken this horizontal development.
Proposal:
Facilitate the horizontal development of KLIMA by pairing 100,000 BCT with 100,000 pKLIMA from the DAO’s wallet to redeem 100,000 KLIMA, to pool with ~$2,000,000 USDC, strategically deepening our Klima/USDC LP from $1.8mn to $5.8mn.

KIP-17: Delegate Retirement Aggregator Inclusions,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xc8e25eb8aa499b343c521c3ff339923f7743cc76a9b08ca14568c89feab3fff9,"Summary:
Grant Policy and Partnerships departments the right to vet and include new carbon assets in the KlimaDAO retirement aggregator without individual KIP votes.
Explanation:
With the upcoming launch of the KlimaDAO retirement tool, a procedure must be established for including carbon assets in the aggregator.
In order to drive adoption and utilization of tokenized carbon offsets, we propose allowing any asset deemed viable by the Partnerships and Policy teams to be added to the retirement aggregator.
Since the aggregator charges a 1% fee on all retirements in terms of the carbon token retired, any asset added to the retirement aggregator will result in non-dilutive revenue denominated in that asset flowing into the treasury.
On one hand, this non-dilutive revenue is “free” to the treasury, because no bonds had to be issued for it. On the other hand, in order to back KLIMA, any new token added to the aggregator must be approved as a reserve asset if it is not already bondable.
Passage of this KIP would establish a clear “integration funnel” for new carbon assets, as outlined in the corresponding forum post.
Benefits:
Generates non-dilutive revenue (no KLIMA is minted against fees received) denominated in the tokenized carbon credit retired.
Provides a more gradual path to inclusion in the KlimaDAO treasury for new bridging partners and carbon pools.
Enhances utility of included carbon assets, driving adoption of the on-chain carbon market.
Proposal:
For: Delegate inclusions. Grant the DAO contributors within the Partnerships and Policy departments the right to add new carbon tokens to the Retirement Aggregator and include them as reserve assets in the treasury. Enabling bonding (dilutive revenue) for any new asset will still require a KIP vote.
Against: Do NOT delegate. Only allow bondable assets to be included in the retirement aggregator by default. Future KIPs would be required to allow carbon offset tokens to be included in the retirement aggregator if they are not already bondable.

Allow up to 1 million total pKLIMA from the DAO allocation to be utilized for bolstering KLIMA-paired liquidity pools.
Disband an additional 25% of BCT/USDC LP to deepen KLIMA/USDC liquidity and better utilize capital.
Proposal
The community allocation of pKLIMA is a strategic reserve that can fulfill key DAO initiatives requiring KLIMA, such as seeding new liquidity pools or bolstering existing pools. The initial use of pKLIMA to deepen our KLIMA/USDC LP is an example of how we can utilize pKLIMA to direct treasury funds where they are most needed.
Policy requests permission for the following:
A strategic liquidity bolstering budget of 1 million pKLIMA, to be utilized no more frequently than once every 2 weeks, in batches not exceeding 3% of circulating KLIMA supply.
Disband an additional 25% of the current BCT/USDC liquidity, for similar reasons outlined in KIP-13, based on current % utilization and trade size of this pool.

KIP-19: Internal Governance Model,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x5518f644377aad2bbf2a25296215ad7db257ad983fe67973927daca051213d7b,"Summary:
Formalize the roles, responsibilities and delegated decision authorities of DAO contributors to improve our ability to execute on KlimaDAO’s product and platform strategy, with appropriate transparency and accountability mechanisms.
Establish a working group to research and develop a decentralization roadmap for the DAO.
Motivation:
The broader organization of individuals involved in contributing to KlimaDAO’s development (the “DAO”) started on October 13, 2021. At this time, community members looking to get involved were invited to join the Contributor Discord server and to find ways of adding value. This self-guided approach led to a large number of contributors joining the DAO in a very short timeframe, and eventually, a functionally-oriented structure organically emerged with individuals assuming different roles and responsibilities across the DAO.
In the months that followed, the DAO began experiencing growing pains as a result of its informal ways of working, particularly in regards to how work gets done, and how decisions get made within the context of a fully-remote and distributed team. These issues were primarily driven by the difficulty in coordinating a large number of contributors without the processes and systems in place to support them, and the lack of an internally agreed upon framework for how the DAO should make decisions and act to balance the competing needs of quality, transparency, risk, decentralization and speed.
Over the same time-period, however, the market opportunity and strategic goals for KlimaDAO have become increasingly clear. The goal for KlimaDAO is to create an asset-based reserve currency to accelerate the growth of ReFi and to provide transparent and frictionless access to the carbon market; the goal of the Klima Infinity Product is to improve accessibility and create value for various ecosystem participants through SaaS-style distribution and world-class product experiences that drive funding to climate action.
Like any early-stage venture, the ability for KlimaDAO to move fast and execute with a high-degree of excellence is paramount. However, there is often a tradeoff between making a decision quickly versus making a decision that the majority of people agree to. As an early stage Web3 venture, KlimaDAO needs to balance this tradeoff as it finds its way to product-market fit.

Roles, Responsibilities and Delegated Decision Authorities:
The roles outlined below clarify and formalize the existing practices within the DAO that have been in place since launch.
Core Team:
Responsible for executing on KlimaDAO’s strategic vision, and interfacing with external participants (e.g. governments, standards bodies, etc.) to develop and expand the ReFi ecosystem, enabling KlimaDAO’s long-term success.
Delegated decision authority includes recruitment and removal of contributors and functional stewards, approving operational budgets, approving operating model changes, approving compensation structures, and setting legal strategy.
NOTE: at the time of writing, some Core members also happen to be Functional Stewards. For a detailed breakdown of Core Team roles and responsibilities, process for onboarding and relieving members of the Core Team, and a description of how they are remunerated, please see this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LKF65VATQROjradXlnUTwcID8ZOhRo-Qwte73NB6Nq0/edit
Functional Stewards:
Responsible for interfacing with the Core Team to translate strategic vision into actionable projects and work streams; and working with internal and external contributors to execute projects and work streams against proposed budgets, timelines and quality expectations.
Delegated decision authority includes defining roles and responsibilities of contributors within their functional team, proposing new internal and external contributors (i.e. recruitment), and proposing operational budgets for their team, as well as cross-functional projects they own.
Policy Team:
Responsible for economic modeling and formulating monetary policy for the KlimaDAO Platform.
Delegated decision authority includes putting forward KIPs related to treasury monetary policy (e.g. enabling bonds for new assets, allocating treasury funds, adjusting policy parameters such as reward rate), determining minor reward rate adjustments if realized rewards vary significantly from KIP-specified targets, vetting new carbon assets for inclusion in the retirement aggregator, and adjusting bond capacities.
NOTE: some of these powers have been formally delegated to the Policy team in previous KIPs.
Transparency & Accountability:
In delegating decision rights to members of the DAO, we recognize the importance of transparency in maintaining trust. As such, DAO contributors will continue to provide regular updates and progress reports via office hours and Discord; where appropriate, quantitative indicators for performance will be made available to drive accountability and continuous improvement of the DAO (such as the weekly treasury performance updates we publish in the #metrics Discord channel).
Beyond that, there are a number of “quick win” opportunities we will implement in the near term to increase transparency and accountability for contributors at all levels:
Create a mechanism for contributors to share feedback about other contributors
Institute a process for the community to suggest the removal of a Core Team member or Functional Steward in the extreme event that they are not performing their duties or are abusing their power
Provide a quarterly community update to share information on core workstreams and in-flight projects across the DAO
Document how Contributors are compensated and publish monthly departmental budgets and contribution sheets (without exposing anyone to risk of personal identification)
Create a formal process for anyone to provide feedback or suggest changes or improvements to the KlimaDAO protocol or product
Publish a DAO wallet runway analysis
Decentralization Roadmap:
While this proposal optimizes the DAO for our short-medium term needs, we also propose that an internal working group be established, tasked with developing a recommended decentralization strategy and roadmap over the medium and long-term. The deliverable of this working group will be a report and set of recommendations, but subsequent KIPs will still be required to implement any proposed changes as and when required.
This working group will be composed of Core Team members, Functional Stewards, Policy Team, Contributors, as well as select community members with demonstrated expertise in decentralized governance. The working group participants and objectives will be established in Q2 2022 within the DAO Contributor Server.
Proposal:
Formalize the roles, responsibilities and delegated decision authorities of DAO contributors to improve our ability to execute on KlimaDAO’s product and platform strategy.
Implement appropriate accountability and transparency mechanisms.
Create a working group to research and develop a decentralization strategy appropriate for KlimaDAO.
Scope:
Powers not explicitly delegated (for example: adding new bonds) remain subject to a KIP vote.

KIP-20: Aave & Curve Whitelist,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x4b57eabc9372a2680df257a5cd1257ac541bed7f82617306162ae6dbeb116707,"Summary:
Seek permission to whitelist Aave & Curve for staking of idle USDC reserves.
Background:
The treasury has additional USDC reserve assets from KIP-13 that are not currently being utilized for liquidity provisioning. The Policy Team is seeking the tactical ability to stake idle USDC in Aave and Curve to mitigate depreciation from inflation and debasement.
This is NOT a long-term treasury strategy, but simply a tool to generate reasonable, low-risk yield on idle treasury stablecoins until they are allocated to a strategic initiative.
Risks: The main risk is smart-contract risk, which is minimal using a thoroughly audited platform like Aave or Curve.
Once funds are staked, it is relatively frictionless to exit the staked position. KlimaDAO could swap out of this particular position via DEXs, but it will lead to slippage. The protocol operates in a trust minimized system that is controlled via smart contracts, and thus risks are minimal utilizing our USDC in Aave.

Whitelist C3 gauges as depositable vaults for treasury assets.
Motivation:
Currently, the assets in our treasury lay dormant and are used purely for backing KLIMA. C3, a recent addition to the ReFi ecosystem, offers gauges for users to stake assets in return for governance. By depositing assets in C3 staking and liquidity gauges, KlimaDAO:
Supports the alliance laid out in KIP-15,
Gains yield on treasury carbon assets, and
Acquires more C3 governance.
Since deposited assets continue to back tokens and (in the case of LP tokens) earn trading fees, there is negligible risk to the KlimaDAO treasury value and inflows. Note that staking in C3 gauges requires a locking period, with boosted rewards for longer periods. This KIP also delegates the right to choose appropriate locking timelines for each staked asset to the Policy team in accordance with broader policy priorities.
Hotfix Changes
The policy team acknowledges the inherent opportunity cost incurred through locked staking: staked reserve assets cannot be paired and staked liquidity assets cannot be reallocated to optimize for liquidity depth, nor can neither asset class be staked elsewhere for potentially more lucrative returns. As such, the policy team proposes the allowance of locked staking, up to a maximum period of 1 day. A future KIP would be required to lock for longer periods of time.
In addition, the policy team will not be depositing any assets into C3 gauges until a) C3 rewards have been ramped up to full capacity and b) the supply of C3 tokens is greater than the demand. In doing so, C3 will be able to grow naturally without a single party engulfing its supply. As KlimaDAO was allocated 10% of C3 tokens vested linearly, it will remain a strong player regardless of depositing.
Proposal
Allow the Policy Team to stake up to 50% of each eligible treasury asset into C3 vaults.
Allow the Policy Team to vote for gauge rewards using locked C3 governance tokens, as a temporary measure until a more decentralized method is developed.

KIP-23: New Framework for Supply Expansion,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xfb993e02d6481161330c3064bbc64cd715eb9814d8bcaaa2a298a0a7aa3d27f1,"Summary
Introduce a new framework for reward rate that takes into account growth metrics specific to KlimaDAO and the on-chain carbon ecosystem. Reduce emissions in the face of current macro market conditions.
Motivation
While most OHM forks are able to sustain rapid supply expansion through reward rate based solely on treasury intake from bonding, KlimaDAO is unique in that its treasury intake is limited by the supply of eligible carbon credits on chain. As such, it is necessary to consider further measurements when determining an appropriate reward rate.
This dilemma presented itself during KIP-14: Resilience Mode, in which the reward rate was lowered 1000% AKR, under the supply stage’s floor of 2000% AKR set by KIP-3: Introduce Policy Framework due to the observation that over the three months between those KIPs, the ReFi space was not growing as rapidly as expected, with carbon bridging stagnated.
Implementation
The policy team proposes to replace the current model with a dynamic one that regulates KLIMA supply expansion based on market conditions. The new framework functions as a market thermostat, where for a given state, the AKR is dependent on:
The ratio of KLIMA supply over eligible on-chain carbon supply, and
The 90-day moving average growth rate of the eligible on-chain carbon supply relative to the growth of KLIMA supply.
That is, optimal KLIMA supply expansion should be in line with the growth of the on-chain carbon offset market.
Call the reward rate determined primarily as a function of the total KLIMA supply and target runway the baseline rate (B). Fix a value for an expected growth rate (GE), a lower growth rate (GL), and a higher growth rate (GH). If the growth rate goes below GL, then the reward rate should be decreased from B. If the growth rate goes above GH, then the reward rate should be increased from B. The magnitude of the increase or decrease is in proportion to the ratio.
Framework
Initial conditions:
Stage: 5M-10M supply
Baseline (B): 300% constant, 100% if inverse bonds are enabled.
Expected growth of on-chain carbon supply (GE): 0.20%
Higher growth of on-chain carbon supply (GH): 0.35%
Lower growth of on-chain carbon supply (GL): 0.10%
Note that the current 90-day moving average growth rate of the on-chain carbon supply is approximately 0.14%. In increasing / decreasing AKR based on the growth rate, it is better to be conservative on the upside and reactive on the downside to ensure long-term sustainability.
Estimated runway
At 300% we are looking at an estimated runway of ~245 days and at 100% it is ~489 days.
It is worth noting that further reduction to 100% upon activation of inverse bonds would be a short term solution to avoid fighting the supply contraction from inverse bonding. Runway would decrease again should AKR return to the baseline 300% after inverse bonding is disabled.
Disclaimers
For the immediate future, the policy team will manually re-evaluate reward rates at regular monthly intervals based on the proposed framework, with potential to automate this process eventually. Policy still retains responsibility for correcting minor deviations from the proposed framework’s target AKR. However, all major adjustments to the AKR will still be put to a vote on the forum and Snapshot.
Since this framework is more complex than the simple OIP-18-inspired supply segmentation in KIP-3, the policy team will need time and experience to tune the parameters and determine if the framework is functioning as intended.
Eventually, if this framework proves successful, we hope to be able to automate adjustments to the reward rate via a thermostat-style controller, and turn over parameter adjustments to a gauge that KLIMA holders can vote on. This current KIP does not constitute a commitment to automate reward rate adjustments: a future KIP would be required to turn control of the reward rate over to such a system.
Lastly, the Policy Team does not commit to this being the final state of the reward rate framework. Time and data are needed in order to build confidence in this new framework, and future KIPs may be proposed as required to evolve the reward rate framework as the protocol matures.
Proposal
Ratify the above framework as a guide for further reward rate changes moving forwards.
Reduce AKR to 300%, or a 5-day reward rate of 1.9%, per the framework.
Pre-approve a further reduction of the AKR target to 100% if inverse bonding is enabled.

KIP-24: Utilize USDC to Extend Development Runway,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x10b6a151ddf29092d4790f655ba4d7de34e42606b51c572d1b849fae670e3a7a,"Summary
Reserve $1.5M of the treasury’s USDC to fund DAO contributor payroll and extend development runway.
Proposal
The DAO should be resilient in the face of prolonged periods of suppressed bonding volume and negative price impact. It is important that during these periods, the DAO continues to build new products and develop the market for ReFi. As such, we propose adjusting our compensation structure to allow for the use of USDC, in addition to KLIMA.
The adjustment would be as follows:
Reserve $1.5M of USDC from the treasury for the purposes of contributor allocations;
Pay contributors their monthly allocations with a combination of USDC and KLIMA; and
Enable the Core Team to decide the ratio between USDC and KLIMA (initially this would be a 50:50 split)
Under the assumptions that price remains constant at $5.50 and bonding inflows continue declining by 13% week-on-week (i.e. bear market scenario), an allocation plan comprising 50:50 split between KLIMA and USDC (up to $1.5M) would extend the runway to February 2023.
Under this option, we extend our runway while retaining optionality with the remainder of our USDC reserves. We will be actively monitoring market conditions and our financial position over the coming months, and may re-evaluate how we fund payroll at a future date. Options for future considerations may include drawing additional USDC reserves from the Treasury or using debt-based payroll financing (amongst other options).
With the additional runway provided by the USDC reserves, and a significantly leaner and more focused team, we believe we are in an extremely strong position to execute on our product and market development roadmap while weathering any storms that might be ahead of us.

Dissolve 50% of the remaining BCT/USDC LP from the treasury to bolster reserves.
Motivation
The justifications for disbanding BCT/USDC LP over time have been laid out in KIP-13. In summary, the pool use and growth have declined, meaning the resources within have better use elsewhere. This KIP is a continuation of that effort to decommission the BCT/USDC pool.
Unlike previous dissolutions, the resulting tokens from this dissolution will be held in reserve until an appropriate tactical or strategic initiative is passed via a future KIP to allocate them.
The Policy Team is also coordinating with the Engineering Team to ensure all of our operational systems (UI, Dune dashboards, Subgraphs) are prepared for the BCT/USDC pool to be fully deprecated in a subsequent KIP.
Proposal
Dissolve 50% of the current USDC/BCT LP pool, resulting in ~4 million USDC and ~2 million BCT.
The USDC obtained will bolster the treasury’s tactical reserve of stablecoins, enhancing optionality for the protocol
The BCT obtained will provide additional reserves to back KLIMA, extending the staking reward runway and bolstering CC/KLIMA.

KIP-26a: HFC-23 Cleanup Operation,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x2ae3fce131f98bf22ec9ef306a13e359002eaea0d111328149204dfd9dc9b2e4,"Summary
Allocate a limited amount of treasury BCT to remove the problematic HFC-23 credits from the BCT pool and properly dispose of them.
Additional Background
See the bold text in the KIP-26a post on the discussion forum (linked below) for full context and details on the HFC-23 credits in question.
Motivation
Per the KlimaDAO Tokenized Carbon Dashboard’s BCT page, there are approximately 672 thousand tonnes of TCO2 in the BCT pool bridged from Verra’s deprecated HFC-23 methodology, AM0001.
While many have rightly pointed out that these credits should never have been retirable within Verra’s registry - which would have prevented them from being bridged - they met BCT’s initial vintage and methodology criteria and were de-facto allowed into the pool. Once the problem was identified, Toucan promptly excluded the methodology from the BCT pool requirements.
The ReFi community has taken efforts to prevent the use of HFC-23 credits by excluding them from the no-fee automatic redemption function on Toucan’s TCO2 contracts, so anyone trying to consume the HFC-23 credits would have to pay the steep selective redemption fee. They have also been disabled in the KlimaDAO retirement aggregator. However, the presence of these credits is still a limiting factor for the integrity, demand and adoption of BCT as a ReFi building block.
Methodology
While we had hoped to partner with Toucan to equally split the burden of this cleanup initiative, as indicated by Toucan’s official response to our RFC on their governance forum, they have decided not to allocate the capital required to acquire the necessary amount of BCT for their half.
However, they have agreed to collaborate in a more limited manner:
Toucan has implemented a new “redeemAndBurn” function to facilitate pool cleanup. No fees are charged for redemptions made using this function, which saves KlimaDAO roughly 33% in tonne terms (about 335k BCT) on the operation.
They will utilize the accumulated fees in the regenerative BCT selective redemption fee wallet for destroying HFC-23 tonnes (about 14,330 tonnes as of writing, approx. 2% of the HFC-23 total).
If this proposal is approved, the DAO multisig would be used to withdraw at most 672,249 tonnes of BCT from the treasury to be used for permanently destroying the HFC-23 TCO2 tokens.
This amount is quoted as a maximum limit rather than an exact value, because Toucan will be burning the small amount of BCT accumulated in their fee wallet. The exact amount of BCT withdrawn from the treasury and burned will be determined by subtracting the amount burned via the Toucan redemption fee multisig.
NOTE: For community members who would like to participate in the cleanup effort:
any selective redemption of tonnage from the BCT pool will contribute to Toucan’s regenerative fee wallet,
or, you can simply send BCT directly to that fee wallet’s address and it will be burned by Toucan: 0x222aAdfAF8FfA6CC7D89F7E99cf94963b121ADbf
Implications
Destroying treasury BCT to clean up the HFC-23 tonnage is expected to have two primary impacts:
Reduce the amount of excess reserves held in the treasury for backing KLIMA tokens by about 7%, which will reduce staking reward runway by about 140 days at the current reward rate, and reduce CC/KLIMA by about 4%.
Reduce BCT supply by about 3.5% and increase integrity of the BCT pool (currently the treasury’s largest holding).
Proposal
Allocate at most 672,249 tonnes of treasury BCT for the HFC-23 cleanup operation.
Coordinate with Toucan Protocol to:
burn the accumulated BCT fees designated for this purpose,
then utilize the allocated treasury BCT to destroy all remaining HFC-23 tonnes.",105,"[""For: clean up HFC-23 credits\n103.1k\n82.83%"", ""Abstain\n20.9k\n16.77%"", ""Against: do NOT clean up\n491.609\n0.4%""]"
KIP-27: Conservation Phase,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xe69c1ccf0fe4c9a09586c3bd3263d4e8728698319560070cea1209785a2da462,"Summary
Adjust AKR to 20% to reflect the current sluggish state of the on-chain carbon market and conserve the KlimaDAO treasury resources in its pursuit for driving adoption and growth of ReFi.
Motivation
In evaluating the state of the on-chain carbon market and the community approved KIP-23: New Framework for Supply Expansion, the lack of new tokenized carbon offsets coming online translates to 0.013% in 90-day moving average growth rate. This is lower than the initial (GL) condition of 0.10% as stipulated in the framework while KLIMA is expanding at higher orders of magnitude.
Meanwhile, our USDC inverse bonds experiment in the last few weeks has performed as expected in absorbing sell pressure of KLIMA. However, at current AKR, the rate of KLIMA expansion is higher than the capacities allocated for inverse bonds. During 4 weeks of inverse bonds experiment, the protocol burned 124,022 KLIMA and minted 285,070 KLIMA in rewards, which translates to 40,262 new KLIMA in circulation on average weekly. Although inverse bonds accomplished its intended objective, this comes at a huge price obviously and is overly taxing the treasury resources.
After the conclusion of the current inverse bonds experiment, the Policy Team proposes to reduce AKR to 20% or a reward rate of 0.0115% at 81% staked. This would increase our runway to about 2080 days. At this reward rate, the protocol will be minting about 20,340 weekly. This benefits KlimaDAO primarily in 2 ways:
This is more capital efficient for the protocol than the current state and would bring KLIMA expansion rate closer to reflect the current growth of the on-chain carbon market. Without deploying further capital via inverse bonds, we will then be able to reserve precious treasury resources for future strategic efforts.
It is also more beneficial to KLIMA holders as this dramatically slows down the rate of CC/KLIMA from being eroded away too quickly.
While it might be ideal for some protocols to turn expansion off completely and go into hibernation, we strive to remain competitive to drive adoption without overly taxing the protocol. It is crucial to note that this AKR adjustment does not mean that we are abandoning our mission of being a carbon-backed cryptocurrency, nor does it mean that the downward changes are permanent. Rather, the ability to conserve our energy and careful management in directing resources toward strategic priorities are vital in driving adoption and growth.
Proposal
Upon conclusion of the current USDC inverse bond experiment, reduce AKR to 20% or a reward rate of 0.0115 at 81% staked, as aligned to the lower growth condition (GL) of 0.10% and per the framework laid out in community approved KIP-23.

KIP-28: Build NCT Liquidity,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xd358805de0e8730a9f6e48f0f5f1bd83765d1d6c519d5568accf8be3726cf756,"Summary
Bootstrap liquidity for KLIMA/NCT pair using NCT in the treasury and KLIMA minted from the liquidity bolstering budget. Approve KLIMA/NCT LP bonding.
Motivation
Why KLIMA/NCT?
Recall the horizontal development strategy outlined in KIP-8: to achieve KlimaDAO’s goal of building a highly liquid and efficient on-chain carbon ecosystem, the KLIMA token should be the key liquidity pair for on-chain carbon.
Multiple projects launching soon plan to integrate NCT, signaling potential activity growth around NCT in the near term. Therefore it makes sense for us to consolidate NCT onto our liquidity rails by bootstrapping a modest pool of KLIMA/NCT liquidity, and in future open up KLIMA/NCT LP bonds as needed to grow the pool in line with observed NCT activity.
As we scale our portfolio of KI partners, there is also demand for NCT to be used for retirement. The current swap route via KLIMA>USDC>NCT is not ideal for our community because of the extra fees and slippage incurred when retiring NCT with KLIMA as the input token. Deploying KLIMA/NCT liquidity owned by the protocol will improve the user experience for KI partners and Klimates utilizing NCT for their retirement needs, as well as ensure NCT activity contributes to the growth of the KlimaDAO ecosystem. This is aligned with our broader goal of building on-chain carbon liquidity rails as a self-sustaining public good.
Why now?
The primary concern raised during discussion of the previous RFC from Toucan proposing NCT bonds was the manner in which the mass rebalancing of tonnage from the BCT pool to NCT took place, and the resulting presence of large amounts of rented liquidity provided by the partners who helped Toucan acquire the BCT required for the mass rebalancing.
Since Toucan’s initial RFC, the excess value which was extracted during the mass rebalancing event has been distributed to the appropriate stakeholders - including a significant portion to the KlimaDAO treasury in the form of NCT - based on a good faith allocation developed by KlimaDAO in partnership with Toucan and other stakeholders.
In addition, the rented liquidity has since been pulled, with the bulk of the remaining liquidity NCT/USDC LP held by a multisig, earmarked as permanent liquidity according to the distribution posted on Toucan’s governance forum. Shortly after NCT launched, there was ~$12mn worth of liquidity in the NCT/USDC pool. Now, there is only ~$1mn and ~77% of that is controlled by this multisig managed by Toucan.
As a result, the concern that rented liquidity could be pulled, leaving the KlimaDAO treasury holding the NCT bag, has been substantially mitigated: the rented liquidity has already been pulled, creating a favorable environment for protocol-owned liquidity to enter.
Bootstrapping the Pool
Initially, this proposal would allocate 70k NCT from the treasury reserves to be paired with ~38k KLIMA minted from the liquidity bolstering budget to bootstrap the KLIMA/NCT liquidity pool with ~$300k worth of liquidity. In order to mint this KLIMA from the liquidity bolstering budget, we propose allocating an equal number of BCT tokens from the treasury reserves.*
Bootstrapping this pool is aligned with our pursuit of improving UX as it would lower slippage and transaction fees for modest size swaps from KLIMA to NCT compared to the current routing.
The Policy Team will evaluate NCT adoption over the coming months and open bonding for KLIMA/NCT LP to grow the pool when appropriate.
*Note: Previous liquidity bolstering activities have utilized BCT acquired from dissolving BCT/USDC LP tokens held by the treasury. In this case, the amount of BCT required is quite small, so it’s not worth the manual toil and time required to dissolve LP via the multisig. Final dissolution of the treasury’s BCT/USDC LP will be proposed in a future KIP.
Propose migration of existing NCT/USDC pool
Separate from this KIP, the KlimaDAO Policy Team has also approached Toucan to propose migration of at least some of the permanent NCT/USDC liquidity to KLIMA/NCT in order to minimize fragmentation and align incentives. The current plan is to submit an RFC to the Toucan governance forum once the KLIMA/NCT pool has been bootstrapped. Assuming Toucan engages with the RFC, any terms requiring KlimaDAO governance approval associated with the migration would be addressed in a subsequent proposal.
Implications
This proposal would slightly lower the runway because the treasury NCT deployed into the KLIMA/NCT pool would no longer count as reserves, and the treasury BCT allocated to mint KLIMA from the liquidity bolstering budget will reduce excess reserves as well. As a rough estimate, this operation will reduce excess reserves by ~100k tonnes (~1%) - at the 20% AKR target passed in KIP-27, this will equate to about 20 days reduction from the 2000 day runway expected.
Assuming this KIP passes and all of the existing NCT/USDC liquidity migrates, any existing integrations using the NCT/USDC liquidity pool should be reconfigured to use the (USDC>)KLIMA>NCT route.
Proposal
Allocate 70k tonnes of NCT from the treasury reserves to be paired with ~38k KLIMA minted from the liquidity bolstering budget to bootstrap a KLIMA/NCT pool on SushisSwap Legacy (in line with existing pools) with ~$300k worth of liquidity. Allocate ~38k BCT from the treasury reserves for use in minting the KLIMA from the liquidity bolstering budget.

KIP-29: Build UBO and NBO liquidity,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xe9de3ba110ee4faec24ef39379cdfbdbd36be7b84557e1fb0b31b3f0e033535f,"Summary
Fully dissolve the BCT/USDC pool, and with the use of pKLIMA from the liquidity bolstering budget allocated in KIP-18 to bolster the liquidity of the UBO/KLIMA and NBO/KLIMA pairs.
Motivation
Since the initial proposal to disband a portion of the BCT/USDC pool in KIP-18, the Policy Team has made clear its intention to eventually fully dissolve the treasury’s BCT/USDC LP holdings to bring all of the treasury’s protocol-owned-liquidity in line with the horizontal scaling strategy outlined in KIP-8, consolidating the KLIMA token’s position as the key pair for tokenized carbon assets.
In a similar vein, KlimaDAO aims to have deep liquidity rails for all the verified carbon assets held by the treasury, and at present there is a deficiency in the depth of UBO and NBO liquidity pools. Given the limited supply of credits in the UBO and NBO pools, we should bolster the liquidity for those pools as the current slippage may deter people from using those assets. This will improve the viability of these pools for larger retirements, increasing the diversity of credits the DAO can offer to Klima Infinity partners.
While the removal of the BCT/USDC liquidity pool represents a large proportion of our total liquidity, given that we aim to consolidate around the KLIMA/USDC pool and that it has a 7 day average utilisation of only 1%, the reduction in total liquidity is not an issue. In the event that utilisation does increase, the Policy Team is committed to bolstering the pool with treasury reserves of USDC and KLIMA minted from the liquidity bolstering budget.
At the time of writing, the BCT/USDC pool has 3,689,000 USDC and 2,325,000 BCT. The treasury has 74,886 UBO and 5,071 NBO.
Proposal
The Policy Team proposes:
Disbanding all BCT-USDC LP tokens held by the treasury
Allocating ½ of the UBO in the treasury (about 37,443 tonnes) and pairing it with ~19,223 KLIMA, and ½ of the NBO (about 2,535 tonnes) with ~1770 KLIMA to top up the current liquidity pools for these assets with protocol-owned liquidity.

KIP-30: Reserve USDC to fund operating expenditure,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xa50ab29cec789ef036da914742ad68020b93369f53b5cc1e78511e6c78a979b9,"Summary
Reserve $1.5M USDC from the Treasury to fund 2023 DAO operating expenditure (OPEX).
Motivation
Background
Over the past 12 months, KlimaDAO has facilitated the market for on-chain carbon and helped thousands of organizations and individuals offset their emissions through our infrastructure. Project contributors were essential to getting us here, and they form a key part of our business strategy. Since launch, a combination of full-time, permanent part-time and contract-based (or bounty) contributors have been drawn on to accelerate KlimaDAO’s efforts across a variety of areas.
Challenge to funding sources
In May 2022, KIP-24 was proposed to enable the DAO to utilize reserve USDC from the Treasury to fund payroll and other OPEX (with contributors being paid 50:50 USDC and KLIMA), up to a total of $1.5M USDC. Since then, the pausing of tokenization and bonding - the mechanisms that would normally fund the DAO wallet with KLIMA - changed these initial burn rate assumptions, and meant that we needed to increasingly rely on USDC to fund OPEX.
In response, the DAO accelerated efforts to improve cost controls and performance management processes across the board. Between August and November, the DAO re-prioritized a number of workstreams and reduced OPEX by 40% (from ~$257K/month to ~$155K/month, representing an annualized reduction of ~$1.1M/year) all while maintaining strong momentum.
It has been 7 months since KIP-24, and of the $1.5M earmarked, ~$300K is remaining. The treasury currently holds $9.8M USDC, which largely comes from dissolving the remaining liquidity from the USDC:BCT pools after KIP-25.
Request for USDC allocation
To continue to fund project development and commercialization, the DAO is requesting that an additional $1.5m of the Treasury’s reserves be earmarked for payroll and other OPEX. Alongside our existing cash balance, this will extend runway by approximately 9 months under a burn rate of $170K/month (assuming no additional cash inflows) with a buffer to increase to $200K/month should Core & Stewards feel it appropriate.
Use of funds
The DAO would allocate the funding from KIP-30 toward the following areas.
Product: The DAO will continue to invest heavily in product (engineering, design and product management) to iterate on the foundational infrastructure KlimaDAO built over the last 12 months. New features will improve the accessibility and utility for both on and off-chain market participants (fiat-to-retirement is a recent example of this), and the design team will go deeper into customer discovery and UX design to deliver high conviction product features and improvements.
Growth: We will also be looking to ramp up revenue generating activities like inbound marketing and outbound sales. In both areas, we are nearing the point in which we can scale these activities up and repeatedly capture value (e.g. we are able to build an effective content-driven marketing funnel, and then convert leads into paying customers).
Business: Further work will be required to mature the organization itself. This includes improving the structure and governance model for the DAO and associated entities, building and maintaining high quality finance and accounting systems, and working with teams to increase performance, transparency and accountability.
Supply: Finally, we will continue our collaborations with the registries and other industry stakeholder groups to ensure new tokenized carbon supply can be brought onto Polygon and into the KlimaDAO Treasury. Beyond the registry consultations, the funding will also help pay the salaries of those exploring direct carbon procurement and pool creation opportunities - see our recent RFC on this topic here - as well as developing partnerships with inventory holders to secure future supply.

KIP-31: Introduce Retirement Bonds,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x8e4ef40a18b00d40ad041200d3f30ae7f8c015c2d75560a8b100b126fb4cea78,"Summary
Introduce retirement bonds for using the KLIMA token to retire on-chain carbon. Retirement bonds are a form of inverse bonds where the bonder provides KLIMA tokens in exchange for carbon credits that are immediately retired. These bonds are offered with a maximum slippage amount, acting as an extension of current liquidity pools to support larger retirements.
Motivation
The current tokenomics for the KLIMA token are purely inflationary, with no integrated mechanism for dynamically contracting supply. While inverse bonds are useful in regulating supply and performed as expected during our experiment with USDC, they are not an ideal solution as the USDC sitting within the treasury is a finite resource.
While talking to potential partners looking to retire substantial amounts of digital carbon credits, the current limitations of liquidity pool sizes and structure often result in significant slippage. This dictates the need for a more efficient use of both protocol-owned-liquidity and overall treasury resources to empower organizations to acquire and retire carbon at larger volumes.
Proposal
Introduce Retirement Bonds, where users provide KLIMA to the protocol, which is then burned and the reserve carbon asset immediately retired. This allows the treasury to expand the liquidity needed for targeted pools without diluting existing stakeholders. Only KLIMA tokens are accepted to execute these bonds.
Pricing: Each bond will be offered at the time-weighted average market rate for the specified carbon credit, with slippage capped at 2% and includes a 30% flat DAO fee.
Max Bond Amount: The capacity for each Retirement Bond will be configurable for each carbon credit pool.
Duration: The bonds will be available until all allocated reserve assets are retired or at the end of each month. Each month more reserves can be allocated to Retirement Bond capacity by the Policy Team.
The KLIMA provided to purchase the carbon would be burned (minus 30% fee sent to the DAO)
Implications
What effect will these bonds have on our key protocol metrics?
Other protocols or projects that want to utilize the rebasing nature of KLIMA for retirement purposes also benefit from this, as their retirements can be directed to the retirement bonds. This reduces the downward pressure on the premium that KLIMA holds on carbon tokens, allowing for better efficiency when bonding more reserves to the treasury.
It is worth noting that creating standard inverse bonds with a carbon reserve asset results in additional pool tokens entering liquidity pools. Retirement bonds behave similarly to that of inverse bonds with the exception of retiring the reserve asset rather than releasing it back into the liquidity pool. Therefore, Retirement bonds naturally increase in effectiveness the closer a reserve asset trades 1:1 with the KLIMA token.
Implementation
Develop and introduce retirement bonds.
Allow the Policy team to allocate reserve assets to retirement bonds, not exceeding 5% of total reserves.
Any reserve token held by the treasury that maintains liquidity paired with KLIMA is eligible for retirement bonds.",1,"[""For\n421.9k\n56.24%"", ""Against\n323.3k\n43.1%"", ""Abstain\n4.9k\n0.66%""]"

Deploy capital to fund carbon project development and secure the forward delivery of EEIMP pool compatible credits.
Motivation
Background
Pursuant to KlimaDAO’s mission of rapidly scaling up the deployment of capital toward high-impact sustainability projects, in September, 2022 we proposed the utilization of a set amount of treasury funds toward financing the development of new carbon projects. This effort strongly aligns with the coalition-building necessary to accelerate the on-chain carbon ecosystem’s development and showcase the collaborative potential of the ReFi space.
EEIMP Pool Bootstrapping
C3’s Energy Efficiency and Impact carbon pool design is centered on carbon projects with strong social co-benefits, including small-scale community led energy efficiency projects. The pool is thus designed to impact various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including:
-SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being
-SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
-SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy
-SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
-SDG 13: Climate Action
The types of projects which would qualify for the EEIMP pool include clean cookstoves, clean drinking water, and small biogas plants. Currently, the digital carbon landscape lacks strong representation from these types of projects. Supporting the EEIMP pool’s development is therefore a direct means at increasing the overall diversity of carbon project types on-chain.
Project Support: Improved Cookstoves for Rohingya Refugees in Bangladesh
Project Context
The Improved Cookstoves project in Bangladesh is a small yet significant step to address the fact that globally, more than three billion people use inefficient stoves or polluting open flames to cook their meals, which harms their health as well as the climate and the environment, according to the Clean Cooking Alliance a non-profit focused on the issue. In Bangladesh, Rohingya Refugees live in cramped conditions with limited access to income generating activity or to sources of fuel to boil water and cook food.
The energy-efficient, improved smokeless cookstoves known locally as ‘Chula’ are a massive improvement on the current reliance on traditional stoves or open wood fires, which damage respiratory health exacerbated by the confined space of the dwellings made of tarpaulin. The improved smokeless cookstoves burn wood more efficiently, causing less environmental impact from the extensive wood harvesting for cooking fuel in the forest area surrounding the camps.
StarCB’s full RFC post is available here: https://forum.klimadao.finance/d/131-rfc-eeimp-compatible-project-opportunity-starcb-x-klimadao

SCB mitigates the risk of non-delivery by conducting in depth due diligence on the feasibility and technical parameters of the project. SCB conducts a detailed review of the project developer with whom it is partnering in the project implementation. For this particular project it is VNV, a seasoned project developer with many years of experience. VNV's teams have already completed more than 26 high impact projects which are registered with The Gold Standard, the credits of which have been retired by reputable organizations known for their strict DD standards on the quality of the credits they use, namely PwC, McKinsey or Laudes Foundation etc.
Additionally, KlimaDAO has ensured the following parameters are included in a prepared Verified Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement (VERPA):
-Should a delivery failure occur from this project, StarCB will provide ‘like’ credits from a similar project in terms of vintage, region, certification standard and technology type/methodology.
-Should bridging not be possible at the time of credit delivery, KlimaDAO holds the right to sell the credits at no charge by StarCB to another entity. Any gain from such an action will be sent to the DAO wallet. These potential future transactions will be facilitated via StarCB’s registry account.

KIP-33: Allocate a portion of the retirement aggregator fee to the DAO wallet,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xa2d8bd41a802c91aefec315923c41e8e724032858c5393e18fcd05272e56d5c7,"Summary
Update the retirement aggregator to allocate 80% of the convenience fee to the DAO wallet, where it will be periodically swapped for KLIMA to fund ongoing operational expenses. The remaining 20% of the fee will continue to contribute additional reserves to the treasury for backing KLIMA tokens.
Motivation
The KlimaDAO retirement aggregator (RA) smart contract includes a 1% convenience fee for carbon credit retirements, charged in terms of the carbon to be retired.
Currently, the RA contract simply sends this convenience fee to the treasury, where it serves as additional backing for the KLIMA token and extends staking reward runway. Per KIP-17, the Policy Team has been delegated the authority to add additional carbon credit tokens into the RA, but this KIP does not address how RA fees should be allocated.
When the RA was first released in February 2022, the treasury was still bonding carbon credits - providing DAO wallet inflows - and staking rewards were high compared to the rate of carbon credits being bridged (prior to the Verra one-way bridging moratorium and implementation of KIP-23). Therefore, the most sensible place to send the RA convenience fee was directly to the treasury, where the carbon credit tokens collected serve as additional backing for the KLIMA token.
Currently, without new tokenization of carbon credits, there is little motivation to restart bonding carbon, and at the current staking reward rate the treasury already has 2000 days of runway (about 5 and a half years). Splitting the fee between the treasury and the DAO wallet will contribute to long-term funding of the DAO's ongoing operational expenses (such as product development, partnerships, and infrastructure) in direct proportion to the throughput of the Retirement Aggregator - one of KlimaDAO’s core products.
Proposal
Update the retirement aggregator contracts such that 80% of the convenience fee is sent to the DAO wallet, where it will periodically be swapped for KLIMA.The remaining 20% continues to serve as KLIMA backing.
The initial implementation of the fee swap would rely on manual execution by the DAO multisig, but in future a smart contract would be deployed to swap any fees collected in the DAO wallet for KLIMA, which would then be automatically invoked periodically by a Chainlink Keeper, Gelato, or similar automation service.
Any changes to this fee split are subject to a subsequent KIP governance vote.

Deploy capital to fund carbon project development and secure the forward delivery of nature-based removal credits compatible with C3’s ARBO pool specification.
Motivation
Pursuant to KlimaDAO’s mission of rapidly scaling up the deployment of capital toward high-impact sustainability projects, in September, 2022 we proposed the utilization of a set amount of treasury funds toward financing the development of new carbon projects. This effort drives the coalition-building necessary to accelerate the digital carbon ecosystem’s development, showcasing the collaborative potential of the ReFi space.
ARBO Pool Bootstrapping
C3 currently curates two types of tokenized carbon pools: UBO and NBO. Both of these pools allow the deposit of removal-type credits, but their current curation makes them far more attractive to specific price-classes of credits, and thus technologies (primarily mitigation-type credits). The UBO pool is ideal for renewables and energy efficiency projects, whereas the NBO pool caters to nature-based solutions with a focus on emissions mitigation (e.g. forest protection, improved forest management, and REDD+).
As stated by C3, “In order to meet the needs of clients seeking to diversify their offsetting strategy to include additional emissions removal credits, we are proud to launch the criteria for our ARBO pool criteria (Afforestation and Restoration-based Offset)”.
This proposal directly supports climate action - in partnership with Aither and communities on the ground - as well as providing the KlimaDAO treasury with the necessary tonnage to bootstrap the new ARBO pool and unlock liquidity for an additional class of credits.
The ARBO pool will accept credits from leading registries, including Gold Standard and Verra. See forum proposal linked below for full pool criteria.
Project Support: Kwamisa/Other Reserves Community Forest Project
Project Context
The primary goal of the project activity is to cultivate teak plantations in the degraded forest reserves to improve the livelihood of the local communities and biodiversity, which will ultimately help to combat climate change by increasing the sequestration capacity of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. In addition, the project activity is also providing needed employment to the forest-fringed communities; supporting community-led natural resource management and regeneration to promote reforestation; improving Nutrition, food security and local livelihoods through sustainable use of forests and trees and related income generation.
The project activity is managed by the Private Afforestation Developers Organisation (PADO), an umbrella organization of private forest plantation developers in Ghana. They are the legal owners of the plantations located in Ghana; Kumasi at Kwamisa Forest Reserve located at Offinso Forest District within the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The reserve lies midway between Kumasi-Techiman and the Kumasi–Sunyani Road, about 35 miles north of Kumasi. The area is approximately bounded by the following coordinates: Latitudes between 7o 05' North and 7o 14' North Longitudes between 1o 50'West and 1o 57'West.

Risk Mitigation
Aither’s history in the carbon market and current efforts to accelerate on-chain carbon adoption make our organization a natural ally to the work that KlimaDAO is undertaking. We believe KlimaDAO’s launch was a watershed moment for the VCM and are hopeful to collaborate with the DAO as we explore pathways to bring our carbon projects toward the digital frontier which is Web3.
Additionally, KlimaDAO has ensured the following parameters are included in a prepared Verified Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement (VERPA):
Should a delivery failure occur from this project, Aither will provide ‘like’ credits from a similar project in terms of vintage, certification standard and technology type/methodology.
Should bridging not be possible at the time of credit delivery, KlimaDAO holds the right to sell the credits at no charge by Aither to another entity. Any gain from such an action will be sent to the DAO wallet. These potential future transactions will be facilitated via Aither’s registry account.",1,"[""For\n277.6k\n99.58%"", ""Abstain\n945.456\n0.34%"", ""Against\n214.473\n0.08%""]"
KIP-35: Decentralizing KIPs & Snapshot,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x2cedb818786730e1ecf1a703ccc6ddd1ec3b5d97b3fd05bc178169fe2f094979,"Summary
Form a Klimate Review Committee (KRC) with authority to advance Requests for Comment (RFCs) to formal KIPs, and open Snapshot proposal creation permissions to token holders.
Motivation
In the current governance process, contributors from the Policy team act as a de-facto Review Committee for KlimaDAO: evaluating the community’s feedback on RFCs, drafting KIPs that will be put to a forum vote, and escalating passed forum proposals to Snapshot.
While anyone can post a Request for Comment (RFC) on the governance forum, KlimaDAO Improvement Proposals (KIPs) and Snapshot votes are curated by Policy contributors. This prevents spam and ensures a smooth, orderly governance process, but also limits the ability of aligned community members to contribute to certain stages of the KIP lifecycle. This proposal clarifies the path by which proposals may advance through KlimaDAO governance, increasing credible neutrality and further decentralizing the protocol’s operations.
Proposal
Formation of Klimate Review Committee (KRC)
Create a vetting process for identifying aligned actors from the community, in order to grant forum permissions to community members that will add value to the protocol.
Proof of Participation
Aligned community members will have:
Demonstrated history of meaningful engagement on the forum and/or Discord (of the past 5 KIPs, engaged with 3 or more).
Voted on past proposals via Snapshot (of the past 5 KIPs, voted in 3 or more)
Long-term commitment, as demonstrated by at least a 50% meaningful engagement rate (excluding generic responses like ""I'm for this KIP"") on governance proposals (forum and/or Discord) over the past year (May 2022 - May 2023).
Proof of Value
KRC applicants must demonstrate value added to the KlimaDAO community. This can be done in a multitude of ways. One way to demonstrate value in this context is to have your own idea for evolving the protocol, discussing that idea publicly in Discord, and gaining support of the community or contributors. Another way could be to provide insight on existing RFCs and proactively assist in vetting proposals. Proof of Value should demonstrates original thinking and practical action, so anyone can approach it with their own skill set - but it will require a Functional Steward or member of Core to sponsor the claim.
KRC Application Process
Community members who successfully demonstrate both Proof of Participation and Proof of Value will be inducted as the newly formed Klimate Review Committee (KRC) and given the opportunity to advance RFCs to KIPs.
Role & Structure of the KRC
The KRC will have the authority to advance an RFC to a KIP proposal via a shared forum account that requires majority consensus within the KRC membership to post.
To ensure transparency and accountability, discussions by the KRC will have a public, read-only channel in Discord where deliberations and voting outcomes will be visible to the community. This channel will provide a degree of oversight, ensuring that any actions or decisions made by the KRC are visible and accessible by the community.
KRC members will serve three-month terms, can serve multiple terms, and require a majority vote of the KRC to be removed prematurely. This ensures that the KRC remains a dynamic and accountable body that is responsive to the needs of the community and the overall governance goals of KlimaDAO.
This proposal does not allocate any resources to compensate KRC members, though a subsequent KIP may be appropriate in order to allocate the KRC a budget.
Broaden Snapshot proposal creation permissions
In the spirit of orderly, progressive decentralized governance, this proposal would allow any token holder who meets a wsKLIMA-equivalent holding threshold to advance a passed KIP proposal to Snapshot. The thresholds under consideration are 20 wsKLIMA, 200 wsKLIMA and 1000 wsKLIMA.
Implications
Increasing decentralization always comes with risk. Each step along the journey must be taken deliberately and with careful consideration. This proposal provides a framework for opening up the latter stages of the KIP proposal process to the community, increasing the protocol's credible neutrality and hopefully encouraging greater participation in KlimaDAO governance.
KIPs advance based on “one account, one vote” polling on the forum. If a KIP proposal passes with a 3/5 majority vote (60% minimum), it is escalated to a token-weighted Snapshot vote, where one KLIMA or KLIMA-equivalent (e.g. sKLIMA) counts as one vote.
Under the current governance process, KIPs that pass the forum vote are advanced to a Snapshot vote by a Policy contributor; in the new proposed framework, any token holder who meets the community-voted threshold in wsKLIMA-equivalent holdings can advance KIP proposals that pass the forum vote to Snapshot.
Note: Policy contributors will still advance proposals from the forum to Snapshot in the course of the ordinary governance process; this proposal simply opens the door for token holders to post proposals to Snapshot.
Proposals advanced directly to Snapshot, without going through the informal forum vote, should only be considered under extreme and urgent circumstances. Any proposals that skirt or avoid the governance process should be viewed with extreme skepticism by Snapshot token voters.
Implementation
Should this proposal pass, an application process will be created whereby any community member who demonstrates Proof of Engagement and Proof of Value will be eligible to apply to join the KRC. A community member must have a Core member or Steward vouch for their Proof-of-Value claim and sponsor them until the KRC has enough members to be formally established. The lower bound for a functional KRC is five members; the upper bound is 11 members.
Once the KRC is formally established, future addition and removal of members would be determined within the KRC itself via majority vote, subject to the specified upper and lower bounds of headcount. The application process and required qualifications outlined above would remain in place, but with final admission decided by existing KRC members.
The KRC will operate in public. A channel will be established in the KlimaDAO Discord server, writable by KRC members and readable by all the community. Each KRC cohort will elect an administrator that is responsible for carrying out the will of the KRC and operating the KRC forum account accordingly, i.e. posting passed RFC proposals and rejecting failed RFC proposals.
A Snapshot strategy will be configured allowing addresses that meet the community-voted threshold in wsKLIMA-equivalent holdings to advance KIP proposals from the forum to Snapshot. Snapshot will also be configured with a 24-hour voting delay to deter any unexpected or rushed proposals, as well as provide a window for final review to catch typos and avoid duplicate proposals.",5,"[""For: 1000 wsKLIMA threshold\n144.4k\n53.49%"", ""For: 200 wsKLIMA threshold\n104.3k\n38.63%"", ""Abstain\n17k\n6.28%"", ""For: 20 wsKLIMA threshold\n3.1k\n1.13%"", ""Against\n1.2k\n0.46%""]"
KIP-36: AKR Realignment,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x28839fab7cf7487c149c2ea5cb69a5ecd40b2ea96d7dc9ead447f4b4b6c70312,"Summary
Considering growth projection of the digital carbon supply, the Policy team recommends a realignment of target AKR from its current rate of 20% to 7%.
Motivation
The Policy team proposed a dynamic model in KIP-23 that regulates KLIMA supply expansion based on market conditions. The framework functions as a market thermostat, where for a given state, the AKR is dependent on:
The ratio of KLIMA supply over eligible digital carbon supply, and
The 90-day moving average growth rate of the eligible digital carbon supply over KLIMA supply.
This will be the first data-driven change under the KIP-23 framework, where we adjust KLIMA supply growth in line with digital carbon supply growth.
Note that the current 90-day moving average growth rate is -0.0034% (bridged carbon has been retired without new tonnage becoming available). The KIP-23 expansion framework uses the 90-day moving average growth rate of digital carbon supply, but in order to maintain a reasonable framework in current conditions, we can instead substitute a projected growth rate for digital carbon supply. If we did not use projected growth rather than historic growth, the proposed AKR should be slightly negative or approximately 0%.
KIP-23 Framework Parameters
Policy recommends using projected digital carbon supply growth:
Baseline AKR (B): 7% constant
Expected growth (GE): 1.00%
Higher growth (GH): 2.85%
Lower growth (GL): 0.00%
OR
The DAO could strictly adhere to KIP-23, using observed digital carbon supply growth:
Baseline AKR (B): 0% constant
And re-evaluate parameters when observed digital carbon supply growth changes substantially.
Methodology
Since May of 2022, Toucan, Moss, and C3 have not been permitted to bridge tonnage from Verra, Gold Standard and other traditional registries, while those organizations react to the 0-1 moment of KlimaDAO igniting demand for digital carbon.
Thus, the digital carbon supply has been relatively stagnant in 2023. While in a period of low growth in digital carbon supply, KLIMA supply growth outpaces carbon supply growth, indicating that the AKR should be reduced.
Meanwhile, other players are stepping up to facilitate new supply of digital carbon. Although the digital carbon supply has not grown in the past year, reducing down to 0% AKR just as there are finally digitally-native tonnes being issued from novel registries seems inappropriate.
Examples of Novel Standards Expected to Issue Credits in 2023
Coorest: Coorest introduces a new carbon standard based on blockchain technology and facilitated by digital measurement, reporting, and verification (dMRV) gleaned from satellite data. They have a project pipeline that is expected to bring thousands of tonnes on-chain in 2023.
Coorest in particular has already advanced an RFC on the forum for inclusion of their CCO2 credits in Carbonmark.
Nori: Nori is a Polygon-based issuer specifically oriented toward carbon removals (currently using soil organic carbon) . Per their partnership announcement with Bayer, Nori has a project pipeline projected to deliver “hundreds of thousands” of tonnes of carbon removal this year onto Polygon.
Regen Network: Regen network is a blockchain-native solution housed on the Cosmos network. They connect project developers and stakeholders across a variety of regions and methodologies, facilitate retiring of NCT and other credits, and have a pipeline that is expected to issue a few million digitally-native tonnes in 2023.
However, given the limited interoperability with the Cosmos network at the moment, and the high premium Regen projects charge on tonnage, we should significantly discount these tonnes when accounting for the digital carbon growth rate.
NOTE: the individual issuers provided as examples here may or may not pass the governance process to integrate into KlimaDAO’s infrastructure - but they are indicative of the scale of tonnage expected to be issued natively on-chain over the next year.
Projecting Expected Supply Growth
The observed slowdown in the growth rate of digital carbon supply in 2023 dictates an adjustment to the AKR.
While the exact tonnage expected from bridging once two-way bridges are permitted by traditional registries remains uncertain, aligning AKR more closely with current expectations is crucial. In the revised KIP-23 reward rate framework, a 90-day moving average growth rate was proposed. However, due to limited data and bridging volume, this proposal slightly amends the KIP-23 methodology to match KLIMA supply growth with the expected growth of the digital carbon market.
An AKR of 7% will create 583,920 KLIMA over the next 12 months in staking rewards.
To achieve a 7% growth in the Digital Carbon Market, approximately 1,427,468 tonnes need to be added to supply (assuming 0 retirements). This total is roughly in line with the expected issuance over the next year from the project pipelines of alternative standards highlighted above.
It is vital to ensure alignment between the growth rates of digital carbon and KLIMA supply. In case of any divergence, the Policy team will propose adjustments to the AKR in accordance with the principles of the KIP-23 framework.
Disclaimers
For the immediate future, the Policy Team will manually re-evaluate reward rates at regular monthly intervals based on the framework, with the potential to automate this process. Policy still retains responsibility for correcting minor deviations from the adopted target AKR.
Lastly, the Policy Team does not commit to this being the final state of the reward rate framework. Time and data are needed in order to build confidence in this framework, and future KIPs may be proposed as required to evolve the reward rate framework as the protocol matures.

KIP-37: Integrate Coorest’s CCO2 into Carbonmark and Retirement Aggregator,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x73667d412854816966b4951efac02923cabe9c1b9720d8480467bcc878ae74f4,"Summary
Add support for Coorest’s CCO2 digital carbon assets in Carbonmark, as well as KlimaDAO’s Retirement Aggregator.
This proposal is in response to an RFC posted by Coorest on April 19th, 2023: https://forum.klimadao.finance/d/203-rfc-blockchain-native-carbon-tokens-coorest-x-klimadao
Motivation
KlimaDAO seeks to offer a diverse array of carbon credits to its users. This goal can be advanced by adopting new digital carbon assets that undergo review and satisfy requirements around additionality, co-benefits, monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV), and industry acceptance.
Coorest’s goal is to expand into partner ecosystems like KlimaDAO with their blockchain-native carbon credit token to gain more adoption for their assets.
Initial review, corroborated by discussions with advisors and among the community on the RFC, found that Coorest’s CCO2 digital carbon assets satisfied minimum requirements across the aforementioned factors.
Proposal
Add support for CCO2 tokens within KlimaDAO’s Retirement Aggregator.
KlimaDAO’s Retirement Aggregator serves as base layer digital carbon infrastructure and provides an interface for selecting digital carbon assets for retirement, as well as handling routing between disparate liquidity pools for any required trading to complete retirements. CCO2 support will allow users to retire their CCO2 tokens and create a retirement certificate via KlimaDAO’s infrastructure, as well as via Coorest’s in-house certificate generating mechanism.
Add support for CCO2 tokens on Carbonmark.
Carbonmark is the Universal Carbon Marketplace – an open-source, publicly available carbon credit market for every organization in the world seeking to acquire, trade, or retire carbon credits. Adding CCO2 listing, trading, buying and retiring support on Carbonmark will grant exposure to this asset for our various partners integrating with Carbonmark. Importantly, it will allow CCO2 to be accessed by digital carbon market participants via the Carbonmark interface, providing the same great user experience for both digitized (a.k.a. bridged) legacy credits and digitally-native credits like CCO2.
Implications
Since May of 2022, new carbon supply has been blocked from being digitized due to a moratorium on bridging by Verra, along with Gold Standard and other traditional carbon registries. This proposal, and the support of CCO2 on Carbonmark and KlimaDAO’s RA, will help increase demand for CCO2s, grow digital carbon supply, and provide a greater diversity of digital carbon assets to users of our products and services.
Implementation
Should this proposal pass, KlimaDAO’s product and engineering team will work with Coorest to add support for CCO2s on Carbonmark and our Retirement Aggregator.
Further collaboration related to liquidity provisioning or bonding, as well as hosting Coorest’s CCO2 generating project NFTs on Carbonmark, will be explored at a later date.",824,"[""For\n177.6k\n99.52%"", ""Against\n653.506\n0.37%"", ""Abstain\n206.288\n0.12%""]"
KIP-38: DAO Funding Request for H2 2023,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x81c5b5e398b91969a63752680807d01896a0156f276cc70a610f96d2e29d7904,"Summary
Reserve $1.2M USDC from the Treasury to fund H2 2023 DAO operating expenditure.
Motivation
Context
KIP-30, which was passed in December 2022, allocated $1.5M USDC from the Treasury to fund operating expenditure for the DAO. This injection of capital enabled us to deliver several projects that continue to position KlimaDAO as the market leader in digital carbon globally.
With the launch of Carbonmark, we have delivered key technologies covering the entire value chain for digital carbon, from tokenization and trading through to retirement and analytics.
Through our webinars, reports and direct engagement with industry bodies, we have improved credibility and educated the market about the benefits of digital carbon.
Through our solutions and sales efforts, we have directly (and indirectly) retired tens of thousands of tonnes of carbon from companies and individuals around the world
The DAO Treasury currently holds $8.3M in USDC, and it is anticipated that by the end of June 2023, the DAO wallet will hold $125K in USDC (and 44K $KLIMA). As per our current policy, the DAO will continue to utilize USDC as the primary payment token for all operating expenditure for the foreseeable future.
To continue to fund project development and growth, the DAO is now requesting an additional allocation of $1.2M USDC from the Treasury for H2 2023 (July to December 2023).
See the forum post and discussion below for full context.
Proposed funding for H2 2023
The DAO is now requesting an allocation of $1.2M USDC from the Treasury to fund operating expenditure for the second half of 2023. Alongside our existing cash balance, the H2 budget request will extend the runway for the DAO until January 2024. This includes ~$188K/month for payroll, and $12K/month for other expenses (e.g. travel, accommodation, events, software, etc.). Note, this runway calculation excludes any future inflows of $KLIMA or $USDC from the sale of digital carbon, trading fees, retirement bonds or traditional bonds.
Use of funds
We propose the following deliverables and workstreams for H2 2023.
Product (Engineering, Product, and Design)
Upgrade Carbonmark with complete core trading and offsetting features

KIP-39: ICR Registry Support,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x1ad86770a117c02e29116cbe27fdd636b9713db959861fb5fa3b4fd24de8f62a,"Summary
The International Carbon Registry (ICR) is focused on enhancing the carbon credit market by fostering transparency and streamlining the carbon credit supply chain to make it as efficient as possible. In ICR’s words, “We believe this can be achieved by leveraging blockchain technology and improving communication among stakeholders.”
The purpose of this KIP is to solidify the relationship between our organizations and jointly work to support credits issued via their registry across KlimaDAO’s core infrastructure, in particular the KlimaDAO retirement aggregator and Carbonmark.
Motivation
Goals
New commodified carbon pools composed of projects with methodologies which currently have low representation on-chain will provide additional client choice and further position the on-chain carbon market as the premier access point for a wide variety of carbon projects with low slippage and minimal transaction fees.
KlimaDAO’s leadership in working with partners to significantly improve the diversity of digital carbon available to our partner and client network (via carbon project financing and carbon registry support) will enhance our value proposition within the DCM and wider climate finance space. This is critical for accelerating the adoption of tokenized carbon for demand-side VCM participants and ultimately scaling climate action.
ICR has stated that they “firmly believe that through our collaboration with the KlimaDAO community, we have the capacity to make meaningful strides in the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) and overall climate projects. This collaboration can significantly propel the advancement of the VCM.”
About the International Carbon Registry
The International Carbon Registry (ICR) is a comprehensive GHG program and a climate registry solution relying on web 3 technology (deployed on the Polygon blockchain) offering a range of tools to help to manage climate projects. The ICR serves as a platform for climate projects of any size where environmental integrity is promoted with credibility, consistency, and transparency of quantification, monitoring, reporting, validation, and verification.
Proposal
Background
Collaboration is crucial when it comes to addressing climate change. This opportunity presents the first official partnership arrangement between a blockchain-based registry and market infrastructure provider. The partnership will require technical teams at ICR and KlimaDAO to build out interoperability between their systems and set a precedent for data and process standardization re. digital carbon transfers and accounting.
Engineering Requirements
Two primary workstreams will begin should this KIP move forward and be ratified via Snapshot voting:
KlimaDAO retirement aggregator support for retiring ICR-issued credits.
Carbonmark support for listing ICR-issued credits.
Additionally, two secondary workstreams are currently being evaluated and would extend collaborative activities after the primary activities are completed:
Data & Process standardization between ICR and KlimaDAO systems (e.g. including ICR credits in KlimaDAO’s Subgraphs and Carbon Dashboard).
Feasibility study for listing ex-ante ICR-issued credits on Carbonmark.
NOTE: this KIP does not grant permission for the KlimaDAO treasury to bond or provide liquidity for ICR-issued credits. Such integrations would require a subsequent KIP.",475,"[""For\n238k\n98.54%"", ""Against\n3.5k\n1.45%"", ""Abstain\n12.242\n0.01%""]"
KIP-40R: Follow-Up to Quadratic Voting Trial,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xb7514d46a80d48f20390ebfd82631846a2696db03550225b7f9ac3e3bf187d88,"Summary
This proposal presents the KlimaDAO community with information relating to KIP-40’s Quadratic Voting governance trial, and requests the community to determine whether to formally ratify the implementation of QV, or revert back to the original 1 token 1 vote system.
Rationale
KlimaDAO's mission to enhance the coordination, transparency, and efficiency of environmental commodities markets is critical. The DAO’s governance structure plays a pivotal role in achieving these objectives. In KIP-40, KlimaDAO engaged in a governance trial using quadratic voting, with Gitcoin Passport used for sybil resistance.
This governance trial demonstrated that Quadratic Voting can be used to govern the DAO and be used to ratify economic and policy decisions. However, the trial also experienced some challenges, and did lead to lower governance participation among token holders.
Below, find considerations in favor of reverting
Considerations in favor of reverting to 1 token 1 vote:
Simplicity and Accessibility: A 1 token 1 vote system is straightforward, making it easier for all stakeholders to understand and participate in the governance process. This simplicity encourages higher participation rates, as stakeholders are not deterred by complex voting mechanisms and reliance on third-party solutions (such as Gitcoin Passports) which demonstrably lead to voter drop-out.
Direct Stakeholder Alignment: The 1 token 1 vote system ensures that those with a larger stake in KlimaDAO have a proportionate influence on its governance decisions.
Incentivizing Governance Participation: By allowing each token to represent one vote, all token holders are incentivized to participate in governance to protect and enhance their KLIMA holdings.
No Sybil Risk: Unlike quadratic voting, a 1 token 1 vote system naturally resists Sybil attacks without imposing additional participation barriers.
Efficiency and Effectiveness: The 1 token 1 vote system is efficient, with a clear and direct correlation between stakeholder holdings and voting power. This efficiency ensures that governance decisions are made swiftly and reflect the preferences of those most aligned in KlimaDAO's success.
Considerations in favor of ratifying quadratic voting:
Anti-plutocracy: Quadratic Voting directly counters plutocratic tendencies by making it cost-prohibitive for wealthy entities to monopolize decision-making. This mechanism ensures that governance decisions reflect the broader community's consensus rather than the interests of a few affluent stakeholders.
Enhanced Collective Representation: Quadratic Voting ensures that governance outcomes align more closely with the community's collective preferences, especially when a majority shares a consistent viewpoint that differs from a few large stakeholders.
Nuanced Decision-Making: Quadratic Voting allows for more nuanced decision-making by capturing the varying degrees of preference among stakeholders on a wide range of issues. By facilitating more refined expressions of preference, QV enhances the quality of collective decisions, making it a valuable tool for guiding the DAO's strategic direction.
“Progressivism” Reflected in Governance: KlimaDAO is de facto a conservative system; KIPs are required to enable any changes from the DAO’s existing state. When a vote passes, changes are implemented; without the vote passing, status quo is maintained. Under 1 token, 1 vote, and with current token distributions, progress (i.e. change) within the DAO can be stymied by just two or three entities, as was evidenced in KIP-36. Conversely, the Community has always expressed itself as progressive (i.e. the majority of holders have always been in favor of change when KIPs are presented) - Quadratic Voting has enabled this progressivism to be manifested at Snapshot (e.g. KIP-45 saw more holders vote “yes”, but a greater number of tokens vote “no”).
Challenges faced during KlimaDAO’s QV Trial
Small holder engagement: KlimaDAO has seen a group of small token-holders consistently turn-out for voting prior to, and during, the QV trial. This group is numbered in the hundreds, hold between 2 $KLIMA and 0.000001 $KLIMA individually, and collectively hold no more than 1,000 $KLIMA. They collectively vote within seconds of a Snapshot being posted. They consistently vote “yes” or “option 1” on all Snapshot votes. It is assumed these token holders are participating in engagement farming quests. Although this is not an issue per se, under QV these holders have outsized influence on voting, despite apparently playing no other meaningful role in the DAO’s mission or its community.
Large holder engagement: Larger token holders (e.g. >1,000 $KLIMA) have gradually reduced their engagement throughout the QV trial. Some holders have expressed that they perceive the value of their vote is reduced through the implementation of QV and have disengaged with the governance process. In KlimaDAO’s most recent Snapshot, only one large token holder participated in governance.
Gitcoin Passport Implementation: the first vote after QV was implemented had a lower voter turnout due to a number of community members not creating a Gitcoin Passport prior to the start of the vote. Furthermore, Gitcoin Passport stamps have an expiry date after a fixed 90 day period - a number of community members had not re-validated their stamps and missed out on subsequent KIPs (57 & 58).
Voter turnout: overall voter turnout (defined by the number of $KLIMA used to vote on Snapshot) under QV was initially on par with turnout prior to the implementation of QV - with some of the highest turnouts in KlimaDAO’s history occurring under QV - however, more recent votes have seen voter turnout significantly decrease, with less than 100,000 $KLIMA being used. It is unknown if this is a direct impact of the QV / Gitcoin implementation; voter fatigue; or changes in the way that governance proposals are communicated to the community.
Holding $KLIMA as a governance token: it has been expressed that community members perceive the value of holding $KLIMA as a means to govern the protocol is reduced under QV, as a smaller amount of $KLIMA is required to exert a similar amount of influence over a given vote.
Risk of Sybil attacks: there has been no evidence of sybil attacks on KlimaDAO’s governance under the QV trial - although it has been expressed as a risk by various community members. It appears that Gitcoin Passports with a low threshold (two stamps, with a score of >0) were sufficient to deter any attacks on the process.
Implementation
The adoption of a 1 token 1 vote system can be implemented immediately on Snapshot, requiring minimal adjustments to current governance processes. This system will replace the proposed quadratic voting framework, maintaining the integrity and simplicity of the governance process.
In order to continue with QV a number of changes should be implemented to improve the robustness and mitigate barriers associated with QV:
Allow Expired Passport Stamps: coordinate with Snapshot to understand if a work around for requiring recurring approvals of Gitcoin Passport can be implemented to reduce voter drop out from unprepared voters, without substantially increasing the risk of sybil attacks.
Improved communication: ensure timely communication from the Protocol Team to ensure all token holders are aware that QV is active, and they may need to verify on Gitcoin Passport to participate in votes.
Change the sequencing of votes: switch “yes” from always being option 1 in a Snapshot vote, to ascertain whether small holders are engaged with governance, or simply voting option 1 to engagement farm.
Conclusion
Governance of a DAO is a complex endeavor - and there are no right or wrong answers. On one hand, it may be (and indeed has been) argued that small token holders should have the ability to express a meaningful vote – as ultimately these small token holders could represent important beneficiaries of KlimaDAO’s tech and treasury (e.g. a project developer). Nevertheless, it may be just as valid to argue that if a stakeholder wishes to drive change at the DAO in a way they see fit, for their own purposes within the markets, then the DAO should be responsive to that desire (when expressed through the accrual of governance tokens), and QV effectively limits the potential impact of influential stakeholders to drive change through token voting. The alternative for any influential stakeholder would be to embark on the (more challenging) journey of consensus building with the community.
The outcome of this proposal will determine whether QV will continue, or for KlimaDAO’s token voting mechanism to revert to 1 token 1 vote.
NOTE: the outcome of this vote does not preclude a future proposal implementing a different voting system from being advanced.
Polling Period
The polling process for this proposal on the future of KlimaDAO’s voting mechanism will begin immediately and conclude one week from today. Per KIP-40, the vote on Snapshot will be executed under 1 token 1 vote.",1,"[""1 token 1 vote\n164.7k\n93.78%"", ""Quadratic Voting\n10.9k\n6.22%""]"
KIP-40: Trial - Progressing KlimaDAO's Governance Framework,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x1e0ddb862433c186478f8ef930c2c4d74f03f9c5ffed99fcf527479c877ff97d,"Summary
Launch a 6-month governance trial of anti-plutocratic voting measures to increase stakeholder influence and engagement in KlimaDAO.
Motivation
KlimaDAO exists to increase coordination, transparency and the efficiency of environmental commodities markets. KlimaDAO’s protocol mechanics and incentives, governance structure, and technology provide a unique set of tools to address key issues within these markets – the tools themselves represent public goods and Common Pool Resources for the market – and they should be governed by the market, for the benefit of the market.
Whilst KlimaDAO has deployed a number of technologies for the Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM) since its launch, and has changed its incentive parameters in line with market conditions; it has not, however, progressed its governance framework. To achieve impact over the long-term, the governance framework of the DAO must be engineered for scale and antifragility, as well as fairness and transparency. Hence, progressing KlimaDAO’s governance is seen as an important step towards minimizing vulnerabilities and downside risks for the protocol, whilst simultaneously positioning the DAO to capitalize on its position as a decentralized protocol that can be used to fulfill the needs of a diverse set of market stakeholders.
To this end, we recommend a trial integration of Gitcoin Passports to increase Sybil Resistance of the Protocol, as well as Snapshot’s Quadratic Voting feature, to explore solutions that can increase the project’s resilience, levels of decentralization and community ownership.
To ratify or annul the trial integration after 6 months, a plutocratic token vote without Gitcoin Passports and Quadratic voting will be performed.
Progressing KlimaDAO’s Governance Framework
Implementing new governance mechanisms can enable the Protocol to remain at the cutting edge of governance within the environmental commodities markets and fulfill key protocol objectives:
Implementation of tactics that support progressive decentralization: KlimaDAO’s DWG Interim Report specifically includes recommendations to consider how the protocol’s governance frameworks can be progressed to mitigate the risks of governance attacks; decentralize governance and decision-making; and increase levels of community ownership.
Further innovation with transparent, inclusive governance mechanisms for the DCM: the Digital Carbon Market (DCM) represents a set of technologies and assets that can help scale climate finance globally. The stakeholders KlimaDAO serves are diverse in type and location. Adhering to design principles (such as Ostrom’s 8 Principles) can support the stewardship of the DCM’s technology and asset layer via KlimaDAO. For example, this proposal can create an environment that enables inclusive community participation in:
Establishment of system boundaries: KlimaDAO’s boundaries are dynamic – with new projects integrating with it at the supply-side and a set of market participants integrating with its tech stack on the demand-side. It is imperative that the system’s boundaries are refined and defined by a broad and engaged community.
Collective-choice arrangements: those that use KlimaDAO’s resources and technologies should have the ability to participate directly and meaningfully in the decision-making process regarding the rules that govern it, to ensure they are relevant, effective and legitimate.
Community self-organization: community members representing stakeholders from across the DCM should be able to effectively leverage KlimaDAO’s governance for their needs; conversely external parties should not be in a position to undermine the rights of the users of the system or the system’s integrity by exploiting intrinsic weaknesses or vulnerabilities.
Why Quadratic Voting?
Quadratic Voting gives people with strong preferences more power to express their views: People with strong preferences are often marginalized in traditional votes, because their votes are worth the same as the votes of people with weaker preferences. With quadratic voting, people with strong preferences can allocate more votes to the issues they care about, which gives them more power to influence the outcome of the vote. This can help to ensure that the decisions that are made are in the best interests of everyone.
Quadratic Voting is more accurate: In traditional voting methods, a stakeholder’s vote has the same weight regardless of how strongly they feel about an issue. This can lead to the passing of policies that do not reflect the true preferences of the majority of voters. Quadratic voting, on the other hand, rewards voters for expressing their true preferences. The policies selected from a quadratic vote are more likely to be the policies that the majority of voters actually want.
Quadratic Voting is more efficient: Voters often have to choose between voting for their most preferred policy or voting for a less preferred policy in order to prevent a less desirable policy from winning. This can lead to voter apathy and users casting “wasted votes” for policies that have no chance of winning. Quadratic voting, on the other hand, allows voters to express their true preferences without fear of wasting their votes. This means that quadratic voting proposals are more likely to produce results that reflect the true preferences of the majority of voters.
Why Sybil Resistance?
In order to be non-manipulable, quadratic voting should be paired with a sybil-resistant mechanism like Gitcoin Passports.
Promoting Trust in the System: For a DAO to function effectively, participants need to trust that the system isn't easily manipulated. Implementing Sybil resistance measures like Gitcoin Passports can enhance this trust, ensuring that members have confidence in the robustness and security of the voting process.
Preserving the Value of Quadratic Voting: Quadratic voting's essence is to allow individuals to express the intensity of their preferences. Without Sybil resistance, bad actors can create multiple accounts to gain undue influence, negating the value quadratic voting brings. Ensuring resistance against such attacks is essential to maintain the efficacy of the quadratic voting mechanism.
Proposal
Gitcoin Passports: Gitcoin Passports serves as an innovative solution to identify unique individuals without violating privacy. It leverages third-party services to offer verified credentials or ""stamps"", which are collectively utilized to verify an individual's identity, without revealing personal information.
Integrating Gitcoin Passport into our governance system will provide a robust mechanism for sybil resistant unique user verification, significantly reducing the risk of vote manipulation. It prevents the same individual from casting multiple votes via different wallets, therefore maintaining a true representation of the individual's voting power.
Users may link:
Coinbase
Discord
Facebook
Github
Google
Linkedin
Twitter
And must have 2 of 7 associated accounts linked to cast a vote.
Quadratic Voting: As a complement to Gitcoin Passports, we propose the adoption of Quadratic Voting, a voting mechanism that empowers minority voices, thus enhancing overall democratic representation. There are two main features of Quadratic Voting. First is a voting calculation with an emphasis on the number of individual voters, rather than the size of their voting power. Second is that each voter has a budget of votes that they can distribute among different options. More information on Quadratic Voting can be found here.
Implications and Implementation
The integration of Gitcoin Passports and Quadratic Voting signifies an important evolution in our governance model. We believe these proposed enhancements will instill greater confidence in our voting system and will provide a more accurate representation of our community's preferences.
However, we understand that these changes may create some obstacles. The introduction of Gitcoin Passports could potentially deter participation due to the additional verification step. Also, Quadratic Voting, while ensuring a fairer vote distribution, might be complex for some users to understand initially.
To address these concerns, we propose a 6-month experiment, during which we will observe the system's impact on participation, engagement, and overall governance health. During this period, we will offer any necessary education and support to help our community navigate these new mechanisms effectively.
If passed, the 6-month trial implementation will begin 2 weeks or 14 calendar days after the closing of this proposal. After trial implementation, a vote to ratify or annul the framework will begin 6 months or 180 calendar days after the first day of implementation. If ratified, the framework will become the new working model for governance. If annulled, the DAO will revert to the traditional governance model. The vote to ratify or annul the framework will use the traditional “one token = one vote” framework.
We strongly encourage our token holders to endorse this trial integration. The successful integration of these features has the potential to fortify our governance process, ensuring that KlimaDAO remains resilient, fair, and reflective of our community's diverse perspectives.

KIP-41: Aither - Limenet Mineral Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x3e705c20f3d53200496daa9c1b75f42826e9418edfd8a1f35eacca49c7a0d4d4,"Summary
Deploy capital to secure the forward delivery of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage tons (CCUS) from Limenet’s solution enabling mineral ocean alkalinity enhancement and directly fund project development into the permanent storage of carbon dioxide in seawater through calcium bicarbonate.
Motivation
Background
Aligned with our ongoing commitment to carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation, we recognize the importance of supporting innovative technologies such as Limenet. The deployment of Limenet technology will catalyze the utilization of ocean alkalinity enhancement, enhancing the marine ecosystem's natural ability to absorb CO2. This initiative is in line with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including:
SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
SDG 13: Climate Action
SDG 14: Life Below Water
SDG 17: Partnerships for the goals
Project Support: Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement with Limenet Technology
Project Context
Limenet's technology represents a groundbreaking approach to permanently storing carbon dioxide in seawater through calcium bicarbonate. By securing 1000 tonnes of mineral ocean alkalinity enhancement, this project will not only contribute to global efforts in reducing CO2 emissions but also protect and sustain marine life. The enhancement of ocean alkalinity is an essential step towards a balanced ecosystem and a resilient planet. Limenet's approach aligns with our commitment to foster innovative solutions that ensure environmental sustainability.
Technology Description
Limenet proposes a new approach for hard-to-abate sectors.
Limenet’s technology produces carbon free slaked lime and negative emissions using low-grade feedstocks containing biogenic carbon like sewage sludges, manure, demolition wood, organic wastes, RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel) and MSW (Municipal Solid Waste). It stores permanently all the CO2 produced by the process in the form of calcium bicarbonates in seawater using a novel technology named Buffered Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (BOAE).
The generation of calcium bicarbonates and their dissolution into the ocean mimics the results of the very well-known weathering of rocks: the raindrops become acidic because of the CO2 present in the atmosphere, and the acidic waters slowly weather the rocks. The weathering of limestone mountains generates the well-known karst phenomenon where poljes above and drainage systems with caves underground are formed by the dissolution of the carbonates. The calcium carbonates are dissolved by the acid rainwater into an aqueous solution of calcium bicarbonate that, reaching the sea through the rivers, is storing safely and permanently (>10k yrs) the CO2 captured by the rain droplets from the atmosphere: the main difference between the natural process and the Limenet one is that the calcium bicarbonates are produced industrially in controlled reactors.
Limenet’s technology consists of 3 different sections:
A steam gasifier for low grade biomasses to generate a flow of high temperature syngas.
An indirect calciner of limestone using oxycombustion of syngas as heat source to produce a flow of slaked lime
A reactor to generate calcium bicarbonates using sea water, the fossil CO2 produced by the calcination of limestone and the biogenic CO2 produced by the oxycombustion of syngas.
The most important features of the Limenet technology are:
permanent storage of the CO2 in seawater in the form of calcium bicarbonates that counteract, as a co-benefit, ocean acidification.
production of carbon-free slaked lime
generation of negative CO2 emissions
high-quality MRV protocol to precisely count negative emissions
use of waste feedstocks for biogenic carbon
widely available globally calcium carbonate (7% of earth's crust); seawater; energy
modularity
deployable worldwide on any coastal area
One potential application:
Limenet can be deployed at limestone quarries, near the sea, using MSW or RDF as feedstock, generating carbon free slaked lime and negative emissions solving the problem of the GHG emissions from landfills and avoiding the fossil CO2 emitted from MSW incineration plants.
The carbon free slaked lime produced can be used locally to capture and store CO2 from any point source precipitating it as calcium carbonate.
The negative emissions produced by Limenet could be used to offset hard-to-abate industries like the aviation sector.
Risk Mitigation
The Limenet project carries a strong foundation of credibility and innovation, led by an esteemed team from academia. Giovanni Cappello, Stefano Caserini, Mario Grosso, and Simona Masina founded the Desarc Maresanus research group, where they published the first scientific articles related to this technology and filed patents to secure their intellectual property rights. The team's efforts have culminated in the development of the first prototypes, which have been proven to remove kilograms of carbon dioxide through the formation of calcium bicarbonates. This academic rigor and practical success significantly mitigate the potential risks associated with the project, providing a solid and proven basis for the implementation and expected performance of Limenet's technology. It reflects a robust blend of scientific research, innovation, and real-world application that enhances our confidence in the project's success and long-term impact.
A VERPA agreement will be used to set terms for delivery. If tons are not delivered within the timeframe there is a guaranteed 10% buffer of 1.2 months, and an optional 60 calendar day extension may be granted by KlimaDAO - if no extension is granted or no delivery of like tons occurs in the buffer window, the contract cancels and payment is refunded.
Technology Innovation
Limenet has closed the loop on the geological carbon cycle by developing a technology that can permanently store CO₂ through calcium bicarbonates in the ocean. DAC stores carbon in rocks. Limenet’s CCUS’ store it in the largest carbon sink available: the ocean.
Technology Assessment:
Starting from the production of carbon free slaked lime (main business of Limenet), the main differences of the technology is the use of:
MSW (for thermal energy and biogenic CO2).
Buffered Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement storage technology.
Comparing other CDR technology:
Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (Liming). Limenet adds CO2-equilibrated alkalinity to the ocean at the same pH of the seawater instead of increasing the pH of the ocean surface to promote air-sea gas exchanges.
BECCS: Limenet uses the biomass to provide the biogenic CO2 and the energy needed for the CO2 storage (i.e. for the calcination), while the BECCS use the energy of the biomass to produce other energy (electricity, heat, hydrogen, etc.) but must rely on an external CO2 storage.
BiCRS: Limenet could generate up to 2,5 tons of CO₂ net biogenic carbon dioxide removal per ton of biomass while the production of pyrolysis oil is 0,85 tons. BiCRS relies on external class I or class V wells for pyrolysis oil storage.
Biochar production. Limenet traps and stores all the carbon content in the biomass and not only its fixed carbon reducing uncertainties on the CO2 storage durability of biochar.
Carbonation or PCC production: Limenet integrates the limestone calcination CO2 capture with the CO2 storage in the form of calcium bicarbonates without the need for external CO2 storages.
Electrolyze seawater: Limenet increases the ocean alkalinity without changing the pH of the seawater, reducing the risk of abiotic carbonate precipitations and chloride acid formation.
DAC technologies. Limenet integrates biogenic CO2 capture with CO2 storage without the need for external CO2 storage.
The technology gap Limenet wants to solve is to use residual waste and residual biomass to produce negative emissions. This can revitalize the circular economy of biogenic CO2.
Nowadays, one of the biggest challenges is CO2 capture and storage, ocean acidification and waste management. With Limenet technology it is possible to use the carbon content of the MSW to generate negative emissions, carbon free slaked lime and calcium bicarbonates.
With this, it is possible to have a CDR solution with a co-benefit to counteracting ocean acidification. Bicarbonates, indeed, are a buffering solution that equilibrates ocean pH.
To go beyond these results, once biogenic feedstock has finished, Limenet can use just electrical, renewable energy, producing only carbon-free slaked lime.
Limenet and the Geological Carbon Cycle:
Drawing inspiration from the Earth's own systems, Limenet mirrors the geological carbon cycle. This intricate web of interactions allows for the transfer of carbon among different Earth's components, namely the geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere. Each of these plays a pivotal role, acting as colossal carbon reservoirs, overseeing the seamless transition of CO₂.
However, what truly sets Limenet apart is its adeptness at supercharging this process. The geological carbon cycle, while effective, operates on vast geological time scales. Limenet's groundbreaking technology, on the other hand, has been engineered to vastly amplify the speed, condensing what would naturally take millennia into mere hours. By accelerating the dissolution of limestone, and harnessing CO₂ either from ambient air or directly from waste streams, it synergizes with seawater to generate negative emissions, all manifested as calcium bicarbonates.
Beyond Carbon Capture: A Boon for Marine Life
But Limenet's benefits extend beyond just carbon sequestration. The process holds immense ecological promise as well. By introducing carbonate compounds into the oceans, the water's alkalinity gets a substantial boost. Alkalinity, in essence, equips water with a buffer against acidity fluctuations. Given the rampant ocean acidification issues we're witnessing today, this increased alkalinity can offer a vital lifeline for marine ecosystems. It aids in stabilizing marine habitats, providing a conducive environment for marine biota, from the tiniest plankton to the grandest whales, ensuring that they thrive and contribute to a balanced marine ecosystem.
In conclusion, as we stand on the brink of an undeniable climate emergency, innovations like Limenet are not just solutions but crucial lifelines. They represent hope, vision, and a commitment to a more sustainable future, where mankind and nature coexist harmoniously.
Harnessing the Power of Natural Chemistry with Limenet
At the heart of Limenet's pioneering approach lies a fundamental principle of natural chemistry: the reaction between CO₂ and calcium carbonate, leading to the formation of calcium bicarbonate. It's this core chemical interaction, which has been occurring in nature for eons, that Limenet ingeniously harnesses, adapting and amplifying it to meet the urgent demands of our contemporary climate crisis.
While the basis of this procedure is naturally occurring, its acceleration is an intricate dance of science and innovation. This enhancement is achieved through the meticulous introduction of electrical and thermal energy into the system. By doing so, Limenet effectively turbocharges the reaction rate, ensuring that more CO₂ is captured and transformed in significantly shorter durations than what nature would accomplish independently. This is akin to taking a page out of Earth's own playbook and then fast-forwarding through its most crucial parts, all while ensuring the narrative remains intact.
However, Limenet doesn't stop at just enhancing natural processes. Recognizing the imperative to keep the operation sustainable and environmentally sound, there's a deep-seated focus on the energy inputs powering this acceleration. Given that energy consumption invariably correlates with carbon footprints, Limenet's commitment to minimizing environmental impact remains unwavering. Currently, the team is immersed in rigorous testing of a myriad of solutions. These alternatives aim to enable the plant to operate in a hybrid mode, toggling between electricity and biomass. This versatility ensures not only efficient CO₂ conversion but also does so with an eye on overall sustainability, thereby encapsulating a holistic approach to environmental responsibility.
In essence, Limenet embodies a fusion of age-old natural processes with cutting-edge technological innovations. Its mission is clear: to optimize and adapt Earth's own methods for a world where time is of the essence and every molecule of CO₂ captured makes a world of difference.
The three phases of Limenet technology:
Crushing - Calcination – Hydration
The limestone raw material (CaCO₃) is crushed, calcined and then separated into CaO (quicklime) and CO₂, by thermal decomposition in an electrical furnace powered by renewable electricity.
The quicklime is then hydrated to obtain slaked lime (Ca(OH)₂)).
CO₂ abatement - Calcination and production of calcium bicarbonate
Just over half of the slaked lime obtained is used to remove the carbon dioxide produced by calcination. The process takes place in the Limenet reactor, mixing CO₂ and Ca(OH)₂ in seawater: Ca(OH)₂ + 2CO₂ → Ca(HCO₃)₂.
The other half of the slaked lime (Carbon-free) is available for downstream carbon sequestration in phase 3.
Storage of CO₂
Half of the carbon free slaked lime is used to store CO₂ from external sources in the form of calcium bicarbonates. Calcium bicarbonate Ca(HCO₃)₂ product enriches seawater with its alkaline properties.

Tracking with blockchain
To give maximum transparency to our action, we decided to develop, using the blockchain, a method of tracking negative emissions through all the steps of the process. In other words, we have created a virtual mirror of Limenet technology by making the computers (PLCs) of the plant communicate with decentralized databases tracing every operation on Polygon (Ethereum second layer). Our negative emission certificates are realized through a minting of NFT certified by a third party via MRV (monitoring reporting and verification).
The advantages of this tracking are:
maximum transparency to the customer
high traceability for reporting activities
transparency in avoiding double counting
Implications & Implementation
All tons purchased, and all future tons produced by Limenet, will be tokenized using QC3. Purchased tons will seamlessly integrate into the on-chain carbon market, and be available exclusively on-chain. This tokenization is expected to bolster the network's overall efficiency, offer price discovery, and bring added dynamism and transparency to the process. Moreover, KlimaDAO anticipates that this initiative will create increased economic activity on-chain, stimulating further growth and innovation within the community. It marks a significant step towards aligning environmental stewardship with technological advancement, fostering a synergy that supports both ecological sustainability and economic vitality.
KlimaDAO Advantage
CCUS are rarely, if ever, tradable before end-use. KlimaDAO’s purchase creates the opportunity to create a new market for a high-quality environmental asset that has not had a liquid market before. Top-tier quality credits like CCUS are used for retirement, and KlimaDAO will be the first-mover to tokenize and trade these assets. This presents a tremendous opportunity to accelerate and innovate in the market for all parties.
Pricing Considerations
Navigating the intricacies of the mineral ocean alkalinity enhancement sector reveals a landscape rich in potential but also marked by keen competition and fluctuating valuations. For any entity aspiring to solidify its standing in this arena, astute market decisions are paramount. Klima's present position provides a golden opportunity in this regard. The pricing dynamics in this sector underscore its premium nature, with a range that consistently trends toward the higher end, indicating both its rarity and potential.
This advantageous procurement would enable Klima to leverage its position for future negotiations, partnerships, or even potential expansions. It would be a testament to the organization's strategic foresight, keen market insight, and commitment to driving value at every possible juncture. Such a move would not only resonate well with stakeholders and partners but also set Klima apart from competitors, reinforcing its image as an industry frontrunner with an eagle eye for opportunities.
In the broader perspective, by making this acquisition, Klima would be reinforcing its commitment to sustainable and strategic growth in the industry. It's an investment that goes beyond immediate financial returns; it's about cementing Klima's reputation as a visionary in the field, a brand that doesn't just follow trends but sets them, capitalizing on every opportunity to forge a brighter, more dominant future.

Partner with Solid World and SCB, become a Solid World Guardian and deploy capital to create the first liquid forwards market of cookstove credits in the world.
Motivation
Solid World is a commodities trading platform that makes climate financing liquid and transparent. By leveraging innovations in DeFi, such as AMMs and non-custodial rewards contracts, Solid World can create forward liquidity for carbon projects. This creates broadly accessible options for any stakeholder to participate in climate finance at whatever scale is appropriate for them. Suppliers benefit by having a direct path to liquidity for additional working capital with no exclusivity requirements.
In addition to the legal contracts backing the on-chain primitives having supplier-side replacement clauses in cases of non-delivery, Solid World minimizes the chances of non-delivery by leveraging its CRISP (Carbon Risk Identification and Scoring Principles) framework. This informs the forward-selling allowances for projects, minimizing the chances of over-selling supply, in the first place. Currently, Solid World only considers existing planting activity when calculating allowances, as planting timelines can be a major source of uncertainty and subsequent shortfalls.
We will be able to create the first liquid-prepaid market for cookstove credits, expanding market accessibility for project developers via real-time price discovery and a deeply liquid market.
As we have learned from existing efforts to bring liquidity to the Digital Carbon Market, opinionated curation is needed to minimize race-to-the-bottom effects of projects with drastically different price points competing for the same liquidity. Solid World collaboratively defines narrow categories of carbon projects which share a single pool token for price discovery and liquidity. Access to any category of Solid World’s pools is not an arbitrary decision by the internal team, as the top Liquidity Providers have a veto on any new projects attempting to enter the pool. These are the grounds for how governance for pools is done - consensus from those with skin in the game.
Solid World’s smart contracts have been audited by Dedaub, a well-respected blockchain security auditor with a track record of working with major blockchains and protocols. The two audits we have received as well as our smart contracts can be publicly viewed on Github. We work with PwC Legal Estonia to ensure appropriate legal structuring.

Deployment details for the above scenarios can be found here. Note that parameters regarding fees and Guardian participation for the Curation Council remain the same after the liquidity deployment update occurs.
Auxiliary Opportunity
Listing prepaid carbon contracts on Carbonmark
Solid World is an ideal partner for Carbonmark when it comes to listing prepaid carbon credits. Our platform offers a unique opportunity for carbon project developers to tokenize their forward supply and access liquidity through our prepaid carbon liquidity pools. By collaborating with Solid World, Carbonmark can enhance its marketplace by providing a diverse range of premium forward carbon credits that meet stringent sustainability criteria.
One of the key advantages of partnering with Solid World is the transparency and reliability they bring to the table. The CRISP framework ensures that all collaborating projects adhere to rigorous standards and undergo comprehensive risk assessment prior to ex-ante tokenization. This level of transparency instills confidence in buyers and promotes trust within the VCM.
Additionally, Solid World's approach results in transparent pricing, enabling Carbonmark to showcase accurate and up-to-date market prices for prepaid carbon credits. This transparency empowers buyers and sellers to make informed decisions based on real-time market dynamics.
Solid World's forward carbon liquidity pools provide continuous access to inventory, enabling Carbonmark to list projects at various price points and cater to the needs of a diverse range of buyers.
Furthermore, Solid World is committed to fostering strong partnerships and providing incentives to successful integrators. We are open to working closely with Carbonmark to deepen our relationship and explore mutually beneficial incentives that encourage increased market activity and liquidity on the Carbonmark platform.
Risk Mitigation
KlimaDAO has already entered into a standard VERPA agreement with SCB ensuring delivery of these tonnes. However, given that a liquid market is now being created, a new long-tail risk is created in the black-swan event of non-delivery of KlimaDAO’s future position and a redemption from Solid World’s pool that could leave KlimaDAO with less carbon than is owed. In this rare event of future non-delivery with subsequent redemption of liquid credits, KlimaDAO elects to earmark a portion of USDC in a non-delivery fund. The non-delivery fund will be entirely USDC, will be equal to 140% the carbon value of deployment, and will be placed in Aave to maintain purchasing power against inflation. The fund will remain in the DAO wallet, will be earmarked for any potential non-delivery risks, and will be removed whenever the delivery risk is completely removed from the position.
Polling Period
The polling process begins now and will end at 17:00 UTC on September 18th, 2023. Assuming the snapshot proposal is approved, we will proceed with the deployment of a CRISP-C pool.

KIP-44: Aligning KLIMA Supply Expansion with DCM Supply Growth,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x887fdf4514f9ceacda3b8d38b02ceb81f9c82d5265167c5b63ad13de3a9bf636,"Summary
Introduce a new framework that aligns KLIMA supply expansion with the growth of the Digital Carbon Market (DCM). This proposal aims to create a long-term sustainable and responsive mechanism for KLIMA issuance, directly tied to the expansion of the DCM.
Motivation
KlimaDAO's unique position in the carbon market necessitates a nuanced approach to supply expansion. KlimaDAO's treasury is intricately linked to the availability of digital carbon credits. Therefore, it is imperative to align KLIMA supply expansion with the growth of the Digital Carbon Market (DCM).
At its core, KlimaDAO is not just another OHM fork or DeFi protocol; it is an economic engine designed to drive the Digital Carbon Market (DCM). While expansion of the supply is one of the long term goals of KlimaDAO, doing so too quickly would be detrimental to our ability to generate revenue through bonding. The KLIMA token serves as a representation of carbon assets. Therefore, the health and growth of KLIMA are intrinsically tied to the growth of the DCM.
Liquidity and Market Depth: A growing DCM provides the necessary liquidity and market depth that make the KLIMA ecosystem more robust. More liquidity means less price volatility, which in turn attracts more participants to the KLIMA ecosystem.
Price Discovery and Efficiency: The DCM and KLIMA are two sides of the same coin. As the DCM grows, it provides better price signals, which are crucial for efficient market operation. This efficiency is transmitted to the KLIMA ecosystem, enhancing its economic viability.
Network Effects and Utility: The utility of KLIMA is maximized when it is deeply integrated into a thriving DCM. A growing DCM attracts more participants, which in turn increases the utility and demand for KLIMA. This creates a virtuous cycle of growth for both.
Sustainability and Long-Term Viability: A growing DCM indicates a healthy demand for carbon credits, which is a positive signal for the long-term sustainability of the KLIMA ecosystem. If KLIMA supply grows without corresponding growth in the DCM, it risks becoming a speculative asset detached from its fundamental value proposition.
Capital Allocation and Incentive Alignment: By tying KLIMA supply growth to DCM growth, we ensure that capital and resources are allocated in a manner that is directly beneficial to our core mission of carbon offsetting. This alignment of incentives is crucial for the long-term success of both KLIMA and the DCM.
Implementation
We propose a dynamic framework that adjusts the Annual KLIMA Rate (AKR) based on the growth rate of the DCM. The new framework will function as a market thermostat, where the AKR is dependent on:
The annual supply growth rate of the DCM.
The threshold (T) of supply divergence between current AKR and DCM supply growth
Optimal KLIMA supply expansion will be in sync with the growth of the DCM.
Framework
AKR = DCM supply growth
Initial Conditions:
Starting KLIMA supply: 8.75mn
Minimum AKR: 0.00%
Threshold for AKR adjustment: 0.50% DCM supply divergence from current AKR
Current AKR: 21.57%
Current DCM Supply: -0.23%
Resulting AKR: 0.00%
Adjustment Period: 40 epochs (2 weeks)
Mechanics:
Minimum AKR: The AKR will never fall below 0%, irrespective of negative DCM supply growth.
Threshold for AKR Adjustment: If the supply growth rate of the DCM diverges from the current AKR by more than the threshold (T), an AKR adjustment will be triggered.
Adjustment Period: Any adjustment in AKR will be implemented gradually over 40 epochs, to allow for market adaptation and to mitigate shock.
Proportional Change: The magnitude of the AKR adjustment will be proportional to the divergence from the current AKR, and will gradually adjust over 40 epochs at a standardized rate proportional to the divergence from current AKR.
Methodology:
Calculate the 600-epoch simple moving average supply growth rate of the DCM, annualize that SMA to get DCM supply. (https://github.com/KlimaDAO/klima-subgraph/blob/staging/polygon-digital-carbon/src/sKlimaV1.ts#L21)
Compare this rate with the current AKR. If the divergence exceeds the threshold (T), trigger an AKR adjustment.
Implement the AKR adjustment gradually over the next 40 epochs.
Re-evaluate the AKR and DCM growth rate at regular daily intervals to determine if further adjustments are needed, and automate as soon as the framework proves resilient.
Implementation:
Upon approval of this framework, the Policy Team will manually adjust the AKR based on these guidelines. Automation of this process remains a future objective, contingent on the framework's success and stability.
Proposal:
By adopting this revised framework, we align KLIMA's supply expansion more closely with the growth of the Digital Carbon Market, while also introducing safeguards and gradual adjustments to maintain ecosystem stability. We strongly encourage all members to engage with this proposal and cast their votes.
Ratify this new framework as the guiding principle for future AKR adjustments.
Implement the initial conditions and parameters as outlined in the Framework section.

KIP-45: Separate Carbonmark from KlimaDAO and fund expansion strategy,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xdf77bfc03e2e30d4d1555b436820f699208b3638ae5e328ac1a6abc8dcb79aed,"Summary
KlimaDAO has become a cornerstone in the Digital Carbon Market since its launch in October 2021, successfully supporting the tokenization of over 25 million carbon credits and pioneering innovations in the field. However, an operational focus divergence has surfaced, with the majority of internal efforts now devoted to Carbonmark.
The proposal aims to resolve this challenge by spinning off Carbonmark into an independent entity. This separation is intended to streamline operations and governance, allowing both KlimaDAO and Carbonmark to pursue their missions with greater focus and efficiency.
For the initial capitalization of Carbonmark, an allocation of 3 million USDC is proposed. This budget will cover legal and administrative expenses and sustain operations for the first 18 months. Following community approval, the process of formalizing Carbonmark as an independent entity will commence.
Through this strategic realignment, KlimaDAO seeks to concentrate on its original mandate while enabling Carbonmark to delve deeper into the Voluntary Carbon Market and bring more adoption to the DCM.
The ultimate goal is to amplify our collective impact on global carbon reduction and mitigation initiatives by leveraging the public blockchain tech stack.
Current Challenges
KlimaDAO's central mission is facing a divergence as more than 80% of our operational focus is now on Carbonmark. Despite this focus, our engagements with the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) are limited due to constraints inherent in our current organizational model. Our on-chain set-up and activities, while innovative, make interacting with traditional off-chain markets cumbersome. This results in a dependency on third-party facilitators that complicates operations and dilutes our focus.
Strengths of KlimaDAO
The KlimaDAO Protocol has a clear flow through bonds and fees from liquidity pools. These flows are subject to volatility and the wider market, but have facilitated the DCM, sustained the treasury and given the DAO the financial muscle needed to continue our mission and develop technology in-house.
Future Opportunities
The empowerment of Carbonmark through this conferment can lead to synergistic developments beneficial for the carbon markets through the continued co-development of the DCM. Furthermore, it can enable the progressing of the KlimaDAO Protocol in line with its original vision by achieving:
Credible Neutrality: Unbundling Carbonmark will help reposition KlimaDAO as a neutral, tech-centric platform, thus potentially attracting more adoption of its governance, products and resources.
A Further Step Toward Decentralization: Executing this proposal is aligned with KlimaDAO's ultimate objective of becoming a fully decentralized organization, which will likely make governance more efficient and responsive to the mandate given to the project from the community.
The overarching goal is to allow both KlimaDAO and Carbonmark to focus on their respective core missions without resource conflicts or governance struggles. By enacting this proposal, we can streamline our operations, facilitate focused growth, and ultimately, maximize our impact on the global carbon markets.
Carbonmark business model
Carbonmark’s core revenue stems from brokerage fees tied to trading volumes. In order to build market share and maximize transaction volume, we are currently pricing our services competitively. These brokerage fees would be distinct from the existing fee system that exists in the KlimaDAO Protocol (e.g. those that come from the Retirement Bonds). In addition to this, as we continue to build value-added features and services on the core product, we anticipate new revenue streams to open up, which may include subscription and advertising fees.
We believe that by having a commercially-incentivized ecosystem built on top of KlimaDAO's infrastructure, we can maximize the chance of success for all stakeholders involved.
Carbonmark currently aims to serve three key users within the Voluntary Carbon Market:
Companies looking to offset their carbon footprint programmatically.
Developers of carbon projects seeking direct access to buyers.
Intermediary traders.
Critical to addressing the needs of (2) and (3) are the changes we propose making as part of KIP-45, including establishing a fit-for-purpose legal entity and delivering a set of key features to enable greater accessibility to the underlying technology.
Beyond these user groups however, we believe our addressable market extends far beyond the VCM. Extending into other environmental asset classes is high on our priority list.
Proposed Steps
Allocate an *additional 3 million $USDC of funding from the DAO for Carbonmark's initial capitalization. This will include $300,000 for legal and administrative costs and 2.7 million $USDC for operational expenses for the first 18 months.
Transfer Carbonmark’s intellectual property rights, assets, and talent to the newly created entity with a more appropriate legal structure to achieve its market aims.
Garner community consensus for the separation via the DAO's formal voting process
Upon receiving the community's approval, the DAO will initiate the legal processes necessary to formalize Carbonmark as an independent entity. Once complete, the Community will be informed on the steps that will be taken for Carbonmark to become fully operational.
For clarity: the proposal for 3 million $USDC requested in this KIP is for additional funding for the initial capitalization of Carbonmark. This KIP(-45) does not intend to utilize any of the pre-allocated funding per KIP-38. The remaining funds allocated in KIP-38 would therefore remain within the DAO wallet for OPEX of all remaining DAO activities (e.g. the Protocol Team operations) post the separation of Carbonmark from DAO activities.",2021,"[""Yes, accept Carbonmark proposal\n441.7k\n68.57%"", ""No, maintain status quo\n202.4k\n31.43%""]"

KIP-49: Liquidity Rebalancing - Redeem a Portion of KLIMA/USDC,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x597dc7652b5e8af47eb33f0dbd067eda188465e90ea4e22dfd1dbb9f775a4a86,"Summary
Redeem a portion of the KLIMA/USDC liquidity pool to direct KLIMA liquidity to other markets and fund strategic partnerships that create long-term value for KlimaDAO.
Motivation
In the early days, KlimaDAO required a robust KLIMA/USDC pool to facilitate a smooth onboarding process for new users. However, the volumes have leveled off, utilization has decreased, and there is far more liquidity on-chain than there needs to be to facilitate an efficient market. It's time to adapt our strategy to maximize utility and value creation.
Increasing liquidity on other markets like centralized exchanges will significantly reduce the barriers to entry for new participants, thereby accelerating the adoption of KLIMA and contributing to our mission of carbon offsetting.
The USDC redeemed will be used for forward purchases and other initiatives that directly contribute to KlimaDAO's value proposition.
There are a few things to consider here:
Increased Accessibility: Many potential users find centralized exchanges (CEXs) to be more user-friendly than DEXs, especially those who are new to the crypto space.
Market Depth: A deeper market on CEXs will make KLIMA more efficient to trade for new users. There is a large user base that trades without self-custody wallets or interacting with decentralized finance, but still want access to the Digital Carbon Market. A deeper $KLIMA market on CEXs is a key signal to larger users. Conversely, a shallower market on chain will cause buy and sell pressure to have more impact on price.
Onboarding Efficiency: Easier onboarding through CEXs will likely lead to increased demand for KLIMA, which in turn will drive up its value and utility.
Implementation
Redeem KLIMA and USDC from the KLIMA/USDC pool leaving $500k TVL in KLIMA/USDC , far in excess of a 20% utilization target when we are realizing average daily trading volumes of $10k/day. With $500k left in the LP and $10k daily utilization the KLIMA/USDC pool is still overfunded relative to market volumes at an estimated 2% utilization rate. When utilization increases, liquidity can easily be re-added to facilitate larger volumes.
The assets will be allocated as follows:
882,352 KLIMA: To be used for bolstering liquidity on other markets.
$750,000 USDC: To be used for strategic partnerships and other value-accretive initiatives.

Framework
Redeem Assets: The team will redeem the specified assets from the KLIMA/USDC pool.
CEX Liquidity: The redeemed KLIMA will be strategically allocated to various centralized exchanges to bolster liquidity.
Strategic Partnerships: The redeemed USDC will be allocated to initiatives that have been vetted for their potential to create long-term value for KlimaDAO.
Future Liquidity: USDC redeemed from this KIP can be used for forward purchases and liquidity provisions for new markets.

Given the current market conditions and the increasing demand for nature-based carbon removal solutions, this proposal offers KlimaDAO an excellent opportunity to invest in a project with high social, economic, and environmental impacts while expanding the on-chain carbon ecosystem.
Project Overview
The GroFoundation (GRO) project’s goal is to re-establish natural biodiversity by restoring forest reserves, pocket forests and riverlands. The core concept of the GRO methodology is to work with communities at a grassroots level and incentivize them to plant the trees and act as stewards for the entire project duration. GRO achieves this by funding water and food security projects, rural electrification as well as schools , orphanages and skill centers for education and training. Finally, communities participate in profits from carbon sales and receive microfinance for livelihood projects.
Project Co-Benefits
GRO prides itself in focusing on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) impact and directly collaborates with Local UN Departments. Their methodology is geared towards maximizing social impact for participating communities. In their words: “Initially we focus on infrastructure for water and food security. This gives communities time to “think”. Next, we focus on rural electrification and skills development with special care for orphans, youth and women gaining applicable vocational skills and entrepreneurial training. Finally, we provide unsecured microfinance for livelihood projects in exchange for protecting our trees. Teaching a man to fish is not enough. We want this man or woman to have a boat, a fishing rod, and a fishing net. We want him to catch enough fish so that another person can afford a truck just to transport them to market for sale with enough supply that a third person can open a fish restaurant and a fourth person industrialize fish to multiple other products for export. This is how we beat poverty.”
Relevant SDGs impacted by this project include SDG 1) No Poverty; 8) Decent Work and Economic Growth; 10) Reduced Inequalities; 13) Climate Action; and 15) Life on Land.
Partnership Co-Benefits
GRO offers multiple ways for collaboration beyond purchasing carbon certificates.
-They offer white label solutions for companies to join them in their social impact initiatives, as well as for direct tree planting. These are options that could be made available via KlimaDAO’s website or via Carbonmark.
-GRO has indicated interest in listing additional credits in the Klima ecosystem, either via liquidity pools or via direct listing on Carbonmark.
-Gro has indicated interest in developing case studies leveraging digital carbon in various industry working groups.

KIP-53: Klima Foundation,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x350e2d9e8dc1041b02f2cce4f56f632382a922c1a72c6008f55c420ea44bf660,"Maturing KlimaDAO’s legal framework
The legal team proposes transforming KlimaDAO's structure from a complex real-world entity model into a more streamlined foundation framework. This shift is significant for KlimaDAO as it seeks to optimize its governance and operations while adhering to legal and regulatory requirements.
In the formative period, KlimaDAO was orchestrated within a sophisticated legal framework, utilizing a blend of the most advantageous laws globally to establish a decentralized voting and governance system. This intricate structure was not merely a choice but a necessity, as it aimed to shield the DAO's assets from external pressures, maintain the integrity of its resources, and uphold the principles of true decentralization and governance. Despite the project’s best efforts, the evolution of regulatory landscapes has been sluggish, with states yet to enact definitive legislation that fully recognizes and accommodates the unique nature of DAOs.
The absence of specific DAO laws has compelled KlimaDAO to adapt and utilize existing legal constructs that align closely with our ethos. These frameworks, while effective, often entail intricate administrative processes and can demand a significant investment of time and resources to navigate. As the project continues to evolve, it is clear that a commitment to innovation must also reflect in our legal structure, prompting a transition from the current complex system to a foundation model. This move is strategic, ensuring that we remain at the forefront of legal and regulatory compliance while steadfastly adhering to our decentralized governance principles.
KlimaDAO’s actual system operates under a fiduciary framework where its scope has a substantial legal duty to manage assets in the best interests of, and as instructed by, the community. Furthermore, when a need arises to work closely with strategic partners, both entities are subject to rigorous Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) requirements, necessitating background checks, financial audits, and ongoing compliance reporting.
To address these challenges, KlimaDAO’s legal team has developed this RFC to propose the commencement of transitioning the underlying legal structure to a foundation model.
A number of benefits can be realized by the project through this transition, as foundations offer unique operational and regulatory advantages:
a more stable and enduring structure for KlimaDAO's goals, ensuring long-term impact and transparency.
the possession of their legal identity, enabling them to hold assets, execute contracts, and engage in legal transactions independently, thereby simplifying governance, partnerships and decision-making processes.
simplified KYC and KYB processes affording KlimaDAO the flexibility to integrate more effectively into the wider, dynamic business environment within the carbon and environmental commodity markets.
reduced legal uncertainty during complex financial transactions.
a continued and compliant commitment to KlimaDAO’s decentralized nature, which also allows for its dynamic governance process to continue evolving.
The transition to a foundation will yield several strategic advantages, allowing it to inherit the DAO’s existing asset management directives while streamlining governance, compliance, and operational efficiency.

The primary mission of the Klima Foundation remains the same as that of the DAO historically: to oversee a digital initiative focused on enhancing global decarbonization efforts. The Klima Foundation aspires to revolutionize carbon markets, environmental commodity markets and potentially establish a novel carbon-based monetary system.
The Foundation's primary purposes include promoting blockchain-related technology for carbon markets, supporting KLIMA Improvement Proposals (KIPs), producing educational materials related to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and blockchain technology, and facilitating commercial agreements aligned with these goals.
Alongside the generic and general initiative, the Klima Foundation is working on the development of the KLIMA DAO platform, operated through smart contracts. This platform empowers the KLIMA DAO community to collectively shape its future through decentralized voting. The Klima Foundation also recognizes and endorses contributions from individuals in strategy, IT, and law to promote environmental and climate policies.
The governance structure of the Klima Foundation will include a Board of Directors and the Guarantee Committee.
The President of Klima Foundation
The Board of Directors is overseen by the President of the Board. The president of the Board is ratified via Community vote, nominated by DAO contributors, and may be removed via KIP. The President will legally represent the DAO, and ensure that communication between its various stakeholders is efficient and effective.
ThereisonlyoneDJ is the initial nominee for the Klima Foundation President from KlimaDAO’s current contributor team. ThereisonlyoneDJ has an established history with KlimaDAO – an active contributor and the Functional Steward of the legal department since the project was launched – and a trusted and valued member of the team. They have demonstrated a profound understanding of the legal intricacies that govern decentralized autonomous organizations and have been instrumental in navigating the complex landscape of blockchain legality for KlimaDAO. Furthermore, they have a passion and handson experience in the economic mechanisms that underpin the KlimaDAO Protocol.
It is considered that as KlimaDAO continues its development and charts its pathway under the new foundation model, that an individual who has a track record of delivery at the DAO is prudent for this office.
The Board of Directors
The Board itself holds the powers for the operational management of the Foundation and plays a pivotal role in determining objectives, resource allocation, and financial management, analogous to the role Klima DAO’s Core and Stewards have previously fulfilled at the DAO (per KIP-19).
The directors are not required to be members of the Foundation or residents of the Cayman Islands, allowing for a diverse and global representation. Directors serve at the pleasure of the appointing entities and are subject to removal by decentralized vote. They, whether acting individually or collectively, are entrusted with a fiduciary duty to uphold the best interests of the Foundation and the Protocol.
KlimaDAO’s founders will remain key stakeholders of the project, maintaining oversight of the Foundation and the DAO, and provide non-binding opinions regarding its progress to the Board and the Community – irrespective of whether they choose to continue on as a contributor of the project.
The Guarantee Committee
The Guarantee Committee is an office held within the Foundation, with the intention of ensuring robustness and integrity around KlimaDAO’s ongoing interactions with the carbon markets. Specifically, the Guarantee Committee is tasked with the thorough examination of RFCs brought forth from the market with regards to KlimaDAO’s carbon financing agreements.
The Guarantee Committee members are therefore expected to have significant knowledge and experience within the climate finance and environmental market domains. This Committee will be positioned to shepherd the DAO’s initiatives within the climate finance space, and mitigate risks associated with these activities, considering factors such as technical, economic and reputational risks, and conflicts of interests that may arise within the market. The Community will have the opportunity to affirm new appointments to the Guarantee Committee, via a KIP.
The Committee's authority is exercised with the sole intention of advancing the DAO's interests, ensuring that its operations are not only efficient but also reflective of its core mission. Members of the Guarantee Committee are appointed for a tenure of three years, with the possibility of reappointment, signifying a long-term commitment to the DAO's vision and stability.
Therefore, the Guarantee Committee will have the ability to make recommendations to the community regarding carbon financing initiatives – however, it will not have the ability to make decisions on behalf of the community (i.e. a KIP will still be required to ratify financing agreements).
It is anticipated that the Guarantee Committee will at times work with the Klima Review Committee (defined in KIP-35) to progress or raise concerns around RFCs and KIPs specifically pertaining to climate finance.
KlimaDAO Governance in the Klima Foundation
Whilst the foundation will transition KlimaDAO to a more robust, trusted legal structure that can support the project’s activities within the market - practically speaking the transition would add one process to KlimaDAO’s governance: the Guarantee Committee will have the ability to review and provide opinions on KIPs related to Carbon Financing prior to them moving to Snapshot Voting (in parallel to KIP-deliberation on the Forum).
The below graphics represent the “Current State” and proposed “Future State” of DAO decision making, per this proposal.
Current State
Future State
The intention is for this process is to add robustness to KlimaDAO’s decision making processes in the climate finance arena, and internalize more subject-specific knowledge into the DAO.
The President will be integral to ensuring the Guarantee Committee is able to understand the DAO’s constraints, opportunities and trajectory, and support the Guarantee Committee with the communication of their opinion to the Community to inform the governance process.
Proposed Klima Foundation Bylaws
The primary mission of the Foundation is to oversee a digital initiative meticulously designed to bolster global decarbonization endeavors. At the heart of this initiative lies the creation of a cutting-edge digital platform, dedicated to the tech care of ""carbon offset certificates."" Each certificate serves as a symbolic representation of one metric ton of CO2 emissions averted or absorbed through rigorous environmental protection undertakings. This visionary endeavor is underpinned by the aspiration to confront and surmount the considerable challenges that beset carbon markets, including issues of liquidity, opacity, and inefficiency. The ambition is to not only revolutionize these markets but to potentially establish a commitment to a sustainable future.
With the KLIMA DAO Platform - operating seamlessly via smart contract technology - serves as a stepping stone towards broader horizons, as the Foundation endeavors to broaden its user base, foster strategic alliances with external consultants, and superintend the intricate KLIMA DAO voting system. The core objective is to empower the community of KLIMA DAO users to collectively chart the course of the platform's future through a decentralized voting mechanism. In this endeavor, the Foundation stands as a beacon of transparency, adaptability, and inclusivity, setting the stage for a democratic decision-making process.
Another facet of the Klima Foundation's mission is the commendation and recognition of individuals who lend their expertise in the fields of strategy, IT, and law to advance the cause of environmental and climate policies. This extends to the endorsement of groundbreaking high-tech solutions for environmental monitoring, the pursuit of strategic approaches to mitigate climate change, and the advocacy for responsible environmental stewardship. On a monthly basis, the Foundation identifies these contributors, fostering a culture of environmental responsibility and sustainability within our community.
Moreover, the Foundation aspires to establish a forward-looking smart contract-based pool for tokens, with prospects of forging meaningful partnerships with other decentralized exchanges in the days ahead. This strategic move underscores our commitment to fostering a transparent, sustainable, and collaborative approach to addressing the exigent challenges posed by climate change and environmental degradation.
Beyond these foundational pursuits, the Klima Foundation assumes an even broader mantle: that of safeguarding the environment against the burgeoning impacts of climate change and moderating the pace and magnitude of these changes via the carbon markets.
The Klima Foundation actively seeks collaboration with kindred organizations, foundations, research institutions, and similar entities that share a compatible and harmonious purpose. In order to chart a course towards a sustainable, resilient, and harmonious future for our world.
Furthermore, the primary purposes of this Foundation are to facilitate, support, promote, operate, represent and advance:
the development and adoption of blockchain-related technology and software for the carbon markets;
each DAO Resolution (also defined as “KLIMA IMPROVEMENT PROPOSAL” or “KIP”);
research and education materials concerning decentralized autonomous organizations, software, blockchain or distributed ledger technology-based digital asset and data provision, commerce, translation, aggregation, insurance, quantitative and exchange technology; and
any necessary private use modes or commercial agreements or relationships in furtherance of any of the above.
This Foundation recognizes the intrinsic value of the ""KLIMA DAO PROTOCOL"" and the utmost importance of ensuring its growth and the protection of its core objectives. It is the foundation's fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the Scope itself. Recognizing the potential diverse interests of token holders and the inherent risks that may arise from actions driven by individual benefits rather than the collective good, this clause seeks to maintain the integrity, stability, and mission of the foundation.

KIP-54: Carbon Credit Evaluation and Acquisition Framework,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x0a54c4a80a2ba5adac1641e87b2671fe00c093455f65745f4f085331394fbb64,"Summary
This proposal outlines a framework for KlimaDAO to evaluate and acquire carbon credits. It defines specific criteria and methodologies for assessment, measurement, target project identification, and the establishment of a smart contract architecture for transparent and efficient management.
Motivation
To ensure KlimaDAO's investments in carbon credits are impactful, sustainable, and aligned with our strategic objectives, a clear and comprehensive framework is essential. This proposal aims to enhance decision-making processes, maximize environmental impact, and ensure financial prudence.
Proposal
The framework is designed to support risk minimization and direct capital toward carbon projects that are robust, viable, and impactful. It introduces a scoring system that evaluates potential carbon credit projects across 16 dimensions, including project impact, financial stability, market demand, and alignment with KlimaDAO's mission. This system is designed to quantify the viability and sustainability of projects, thereby facilitating data-driven and risk-aware investment decisions.
The following variables will always be considered:
Methodology: Evaluate the robustness of the project's carbon credit generation methodology.
Certification Standard: Assess the credibility and recognition of the certification standards applied to the carbon credits.
Bridge Support: Determine compatibility with tokenization platforms that support the credits.
Market Demand: Analyze on-chain credit retirements from the previous year and off-chain market demand indicators. For example, the following off-chain data sources may be utilized such as Allied Offsets or CDR.FYI
Country: Consider the country of origin for geopolitical risk, local regulations, and environmental impact.
Environmental and Social Impact Metrics: Review the project's contribution to sustainability and its social and economic co-benefits.
Risk Assessment: Examine the project's financial health and operational risks.
Spot Price: Compare the spot price with the average market price to gauge profitability.
The following considerations must always be weighed:
Measurement:
Quantitative: Leverage on-chain data to assess the methodology distribution, certification standard prevalence, and market demand metrics.
Qualitative: Gather insights from ecosystem marketplace reports, carbon project developer interviews, and trader allies to gauge future demand
Target Projects:
Focus on projects with overlap in known demand sources, such as ITMO buyers and projects from domestic markets that are accepted international credits within compliance systems.
Prioritize projects that lead to a more diversified on-chain carbon market.
With enough data, this framework can be codified:
End-Game:
Smart Contract Architecture: Design contracts for asset management, proposal processing, and transaction tracking.
Data Collection and Integration: Implement systems to gather and integrate data for decision-making.
Automated Reporting: Enable smart contracts to generate and disseminate reports on asset and fund management.
Proposal Management: Automate the proposal submission and approval process, ensuring alignment with KlimaDAO's strategic goals.
With a clear scoring mechanism, procurement decisions can be data-driven.
Weighting Criteria:
A scoring system has been developed to evaluate potential carbon credit projects. Projects must score at least 50 points to proceed past the Request for Comment (RFC) stage. Proposed weighting criteria are as follows:

Project has no clear strategic value to KlimaDAO: 1 point
Projects will be evaluated across these criteria, and the total score will determine their eligibility for further consideration. A project must score a minimum of 50 points to be considered low-risk and eligible for investment.
The scoring process will be conducted by the Protocol team prior to any procurement proposal being presented for escalation to KIP by the KRC.
In the rapidly evolving carbon market, it is imperative that KlimaDAO's investments are not only environmentally and socially responsible but also financially prudent. This framework is established to enhance our decision-making processes, allowing us to identify and invest in projects that offer the highest potential for positive impact and returns.
The primary beneficiaries of this framework are the KlimaDAO community and the broader ecosystem we support. By optimizing our procurement strategy, we ensure the maximization of environmental impact and the advancement of our mission to drive climate action. Furthermore, this structured approach provides transparency and accountability, bolstering confidence among our stakeholders and partners.
We invite the KlimaDAO community to review and engage with this proposal. Your insights and votes are crucial in shaping our approach to carbon credit investments. Together, we can set a new standard for strategic, impactful, and transparent support of environmental projects within the decentralized space, driving us closer to our collective goal of a carbon-neutral world.

KIP-55: The Green Ratio,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xd51cd5b28c4e63d26716dd1c506614fd33a2404d5f28d3f13488c0da8435b8f3,"Context
Historically, KlimaDAO’s deployment of its USDC has been opportunistic and driven by individual KIPs, often leaving significant reserves idle. This approach has led to inefficiencies in spending decisions, with deliberations occurring in an ad-hoc manner, focused in isolation on the merits of a proposal on the forum.
This RFC proposes the implementation of the “Green Ratio” – a framework that will introduce guidance on how the DAO should use its resources at any given time. It is intended to give the community and market stakeholders more clarity over how the DAO intends to act, and ensure the community and contributors can be more efficient and wholistic with economic decision making.
Essentially, the framework will see the DAO codify how it deploys the marginal dollar, which fall into four primary areas:
Forward Carbon
Treasury
OpEx
Carbon Backing
The strategic implications of this framework are such that, during periods of high USDC holdings, the Protocol will be more inclined to take long positions within the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) and other environmental commodities markets. Conversely, during periods of stagnation and decline where USDC is not replenished, the Protocol will necessitate the transition from capital intensive activities to ""labour"" intensive activities that are lower cost, such as: operationalizing treasury carbon assets; Protocol innovation; small-scale incentive spend; partnership and strategic collaborations.
Green Ratio Introduction
The Green Ratio framework dictates the strategic allocation of KlimaDAO’s assets, deployed at a foundational ratio in the range 22:48:10:20 into the following opportunity areas - and help guide the protocol to equilibrium as returns and losses are realised
Furthermore, the ratio will lead to the implementation of:
KPIs:
Give hard indicators on DAO economic decisions and performance across its priority areas.
Conservation:
Impose restrictions on the DAO for certain activities when the ratio is not aligned, for example:
requiring strong justification in a KIP as to why deployments into carbon forward agreements when the ratio is over 32%;
or forcing reduced capital and OpEx spend during extended periods with no new inflows into the the Protocol.
Clear incentives:
Establishing KlimaDAO’s intentions to the market allows stakeholders to understand the DAO’s current state and leverage its governance to pull on its resources and incentives:
In the form of USDC that can be deployed into forward carbon incentives for project developers;
For contributors via an increased OpEx allocation for those who contribute to Protocol activities.
For builders looking to acquire funding to develop technology on top of KlimaDAO’s base layer infrastructure.
Furthermore, all of these groups will be implicitly incentivised to actively support the DAO’s growth and move carbon through the system in order to generate the returns that will lead to the freeing up the ratio for further market incentives.
Decentralization:
Through the creation of a KIP-ratified framework, the ratio can drive and inform KlimaDAO’s growth and economic decision making, and ensure that any work undertaken by the DAO is accountable towards a common, agreed objective; thereby reducing ambiguity and complexity within the DAO.
The policy team will strive to maintain close alignment with this ratio at all times, deploying specific rebalancing activities as needed. Actions that move funds from the treasury to the DAO wallet (i.e. internal accounting), and vice versa are not anticipated to require KIPs, nor are activities that bring inflows into the DAO (e.g. selling carbon).
However, standalone KIPs will still be required to facilitate general economic decision making (such as whitelisting deployments of idle treasury assets into yield opportunities; ratifying VERPA agreements for carbon forward agreements; defining contributor and bounty budgets / initiatives).
The below table defines a number of example actions that can be taken to rebalance the ratio.
Reports at the end of each fiscal quarter will be issued by the Policy Team to the community defining which activities were taken, and detailing the variance from the ratio.
Considering our current asset distribution (12.36% forward carbon, 37.9% treasury, 30.31% OpEx, and 19.43% carbon backing), the proposed allocation is as follows:
22% Forward Carbon Agreements;
48% Treasury;
10% OpEx;
20% Carbon Backing
The 22:48:10:20 ratio is proposed as the starting ratio, although it may be modified via future KIPs as more data and performance metrics come to light.
Tactical Allocation for Rebalancing
To account for fluctuations in market conditions that may cause the asset ratio to drift from the foundational 22:48:10:20 allocation, a tactical allocation of up to 10% of the net asset value is permitted. For example, at any given time as little as 0% or as much as 20% of the treasury may be ring-fenced for OpEx. This shift is not for the exploration of alternative investments but serves as a rebalancing buffer.
The tactical allocation allows the DAO to adjust holdings in each of the primary categories in order to realign them with the foundational 22:48:10:20. Such adjustments should be data-driven and predicated on market analytics.
The tactical allocation will be reviewed in each quarterly report, aiming to restore the foundational allocation, unless market analytics provide a strong justification for maintaining the current course.
Interaction with KlimaDAO’s Workstreams
The Green Ratio creates a high-level framework from which to think about KlimaDAO’s various work streams within and state how they should be funded, without specifying restrictions or requirements on what they should be. Outside of climate financing initiatives, it will define the available funding to experiment and iterate within the DAO, activities which are ultimately funded from the Treasury and OpEx. This brings certainty for funding of BAU activities, but limits spending spinning out of control for activities that do not have prior community sign off.
The framework is presented at a time where the DAO has reduced its operational spend significantly after the passing of KIP-45 – removing the most capital intensive activity (i.e. R&D spend) from the budget. Practically speaking, the Green Ratio creates an opportunity to codify to what extent future R&D activities may get funded, whilst also taking a broader perspective across the DAO’s other areas of strategic focus.
Furthermore, with the passing of KIP-45, the DAO’s Decentralization Working Group is driving towards the development of more comprehensive frameworks that are conducive to further automation and optimal decentralization of the Protocol, that build on its Interim Report. Bringing clarity around how economic decision making happens at KlimaDAO will allow the group to prioritise activities that focus on improving the DAO’s operating model.
Pricing Forward Carbon
The framework is designed to provide clarity as to how KlimaDAO’s assets will be managed in any given market state. To properly provide this clarity, assets owned by the DAO with illiquid price feeds require a standardized approach to marking a valid price point on KlimaDAO’s books. To remove ambiguity of illiquid asset pricing, KlimaDAO will mark all forward carbon at the rate that it was purchased. Only when a sale is realized will the change in asset price be reflected in the ratio. Before any sales of forward carbon, the forward carbon will be priced at the purchase price. After there is a trade made for a batch of forward tonnes, the mark price will change to be the last purchase price for that lot.
Proposal
For the Green Ratio to be a success additional work is required. Specifically, a public “Protocol Data” dashboard on the KlimaDAO website should be developed to inform community members of the state of play and how it is performing against the ratio.
This dashboard will define the ratio at any given time, and be used as a signal to the market as to how they can (and should) use and leverage the DAO's governance and resources, for example:
Underallocated Carbon pot - e.g. “there is an opportunity for the market to acquire funding from the DAO for climate financing initiatives”.
Overallocated OpEx pot - e.g. “there is an opportunity for builders on top of KlimaDAO's base layer infrastructure to apply for funding for an ad-hoc project”
Conclusion
KlimaDAO aspires to coordinate with, and empower organisations to scale-up their impact on the planet via environmental commodity markets; similarly the DAO itself requires organisations to tap into the governance process and leverage the DAO's resources in order for it to be a long-term success and valuable resource for the market.
Ostensibly, this symbiotic relationship that KlimaDAO seeks to have with the market is becoming more understood as exemplified by the more consistent use of its governance Forum by climate finance market stakeholders, builders, and community members who are tapping into the DAO’s knowledge and resources.
The Green Ratio is another step in the direction of bringing more clarity to how KlimaDAO is designed and how it can be used by the market.
The Green Ratio stands to provide a modulating effect on DAO that allows it to react to both the market cycles, and its current exposure, by organising the way that it thinks about its resources: a requirement for long-term success and consistent growth. On a macro timeframe the Green Ratio can ensure that the DAO ebbs and flows in a manner more aligned with market cycles, whilst also giving it the flexibility needed to take agile tactical decisions across its OpEx, Treasury and Carbon initiatives – ensuring it maintains its edge in the dynamic markets it operates within.
Appendix
Worked Examples of Tactical Rebalancing
Carbon Overexposure Example
Due to favorable market conditions and strong returns, KlimaDAO finds that its asset allocation has drifted from the foundational 22:48:10:20 ratio to 35:40:5:20
Carbon: 35%
Treasury: 40%
OpEx: 5%
Carbon Backing: 20%
Tactical Allocation Shift Decision is implemented with the Community:
After a rigorous data analysis, the DAO decides to maintain the overexposure to Forward Carbon Agreements at 35%, diverging from the foundational 22:48:10:20 ratio.
Rationale for Maintaining Overexposure:
Market Momentum: Forward Carbon Agreements are currently benefiting from strong market momentum, indicating that the sector is in a high-growth phase.
Regulatory Tailwinds: Recent government policies favouring carbon-neutral initiatives have bolstered the forward carbon market, signalling a more robust and sustainable growth trajectory.
Competitive Advantage: KlimaDAO's existing agreements are with industry leaders, ensuring both stability and high potential returns.
Risk Mitigation: The DAO assessed the risk associated with the overexposure and concluded that it falls within acceptable limits, especially given the expected returns and the mitigative properties of the other asset categories.
Review and Oversight
This decision will be subject to a review at the end of the next fiscal quarter, aligning with the Green Ratio’s Tactical Allocation Shift provision.
A continued overexposure to Forward Carbon Agreements will be maintained only if market analytics continue to justify this strategy.
If exposure continues to increase due to price appreciation, some forward carbon exposure will need to be reduced.
Treasury Underexposure Example
Due to various market factors, KlimaDAO’s asset allocation has shifted away from the foundational 22:48:10:20 ratio to 25:35:20:20
Carbon: 25%
Treasury: 35%
OpEx: 20%
Carbon Backing: 20%
Following a thorough analysis, the DAO decides to increase the allocation to Treasury Assets specifically targeting on-chain yield opportunities, moving it from 35% to 45% while decreasing OpEx funds held to 10%.
Rationale for Increasing Exposure:
Under Foundational Ratio: Treasury assets were underexposed to yield opportunities, creating a need to increase exposure.
High Yield Rates: Current on-chain yield opportunities are offering higher-than-average returns, making them a compelling addition to balance lower-yielding assets.
Liquidity and Flexibility: On-chain assets provide liquidity and flexibility, enabling KlimaDAO to quickly respond to market changes.
Portfolio Diversification: Increasing exposure to on-chain yield opportunities serves as a counterbalance to the current overexposure to OpEx, enhancing portfolio diversification and extending operational runway through revenue.
Execution:
Using the Tactical Allocation Shift provision, the DAO reallocates 10% from OpEx into Treasury Assets focused on on-chain yield opportunities - a KIP is required to whitelist specific yield opportunities.
Thereby a revised ratio of 25:45:10:20 is realised.
Review and Oversight:
This shift will be re-evaluated at the end of the next fiscal quarter in accordance with the Green Ratio’s Tactical Allocation Shift guidelines.

KIP-56: Presents for the Planet,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xed4d5e0dd7bb16f5db4473e1a98c6851bad152ff4b5feca5802c02567966dc1b,"Summary:
The Presents for the Planet initiative proposes an allocation of $100,000 USDC for the utilization of retirement bonds in order to rebalance $KLIMA and Base Carbon Tons (BCT) within the ecosystem.
The implication of this strategy will be the reduction of BCT and KLIMA in the ecosystem, and acceleration of carbon asset retirement.
Concurrently, a community-centric carbon offsetting drive will be incentivized, with KlimaDAO additionally matching each ton of carbon retired 1:1 (regardless of ton type), up to a maximum of 1,000,000 tons, thereby fostering a collaborative and impactful carbon reduction initiative.
Motivation:
The $KLIMA token is intrinsically tied to the associated carbon assets in the treasury and its liquidity pools (LPs). By systematically activating Retirement Bonds targeted at BCT we stand to rebalance $KLIMA’s alignment towards a more diversified set of carbon, whilst also offsetting carbon emissions via protocol mechanisms.
By initiating retirement bonds focused on BCT, we aim to diversify the carbon assets associated with $KLIMA, enhancing the token’s relevance in the broader environmental context. This approach not only aligns with KlimaDAO's mission of environmental stewardship but also actively engages our community in carbon offsetting initiatives. The proposed matching mechanism in this initiative is designed to incentivize community participation, fostering a sense of collective responsibility and reinforcing our commitment to carbon emission mitigation.
For context, currently, 97.8% of on-chain carbon in KlimaDAO’s treasury – through which $KLIMA is intrinsically tied to via its LPs – is BCT.
This action comes as an extension of KIP-49’s initial rebalancing of treasury assets. Here, the underutilized KLIMA / USDC pool was reduced by 75% to allow for a more efficient market and use of treasury assets. The recent rebalancing of the KLIMA/USDC pool presents a timely opportunity to inject additional liquidity. Our decision to utilize USDC from our treasury surplus for this rebalancing is strategic, optimizing our resources while enhancing the pool's liquidity. This action is not merely about maintaining equilibrium; it's a proactive step towards strengthening $KLIMA's market presence and utility for the ecosystem.
This proposal essentially proposes to continue rebalancing activities further, with a particular focus on carbon holdings, in an attempt to prime the ecosystem and set it up for its next steps - which focuses on onboarding new carbon assets, and shifting KLIMA’s exposure to a more balanced allocation of carbon holdings.
Practically speaking, the proposal will implement retirement bonds (RBs) to reduce the amount of BCT and $KLIMA in the ecosystem through retirements. First, by acquiring $KLIMA in the KLIMA/USDC pool for use in RBs. Second, by retiring BCT with that $KLIMA via retirement bonds.
Hence, the cost to the DAO treasury is 100,000 USDC to acquire that $KLIMA (so, 13.3% of the USDC pulled in KIP-49 rebalancing).
Continuing on with this strategy: further rebalancing towards a diversified set of assets will occur over the next 12 months, as the forward deals that KlimaDAO has engaged with on its Forum will further rebalance on-chain assets towards a more diversified set of carbon, namely:
$USDC 227,000 for 14,276 tonnes Verra ARR credits (via Aither)
$USDC 250,000 for 31,250 tonnes Gold Standard community-based energy efficiency credits (via SCB)
$USDC 600,000 for 1,000 Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement Carbon Dioxide Removal credits (via Limenet)
$USDC 250,000 for 15,151 ICR ARR credits (via GroInitiative)
Therefore, from the Protocol perspective this proposal allows:
Reduced exposure to BCT by directly retiring and incentivizing third-party retirements on-chain
Support for the KLIMA/USDC LP
Increased $KLIMA’s purchasing power for carbon, (e.g. via DEALP)
Preservation of existing $KLIMA in treasury for other strategic deployments (e.g. DEALP, liquidity programmes, etc.)
Furthermore, through the proposed matching programme incentivising community engagement for carbon offsetting will:
Showcase the Protocol’s retirement bond mechanic for carbon offsetting to the market
Accelerate carbon emission reductions via offsetting
Align with Protocol’s long-term strategy of stewarding the environment and environmental commodity markets
Proposal:
Fiscal Allocation:
Dedicate $100,000 USDC from KlimaDAO’s treasury reserves for a systematic acquisition of $5000/KLIMA/week over the ensuing 20 weeks.
Maximum of 1,000,000 tons used for matching of carbon retirements
Strategic Asset Burn:
Channel the acquired KLIMA towards burning BCT via Retirement Bonds, thus reducing the circulating KLIMA supply while directly supporting projects taking positive climate action.
Community-Centric Carbon Reduction:
Launch a community-driven carbon reduction campaign, with a solemn pledge from KlimaDAO to match each ton of carbon reduction 1:1, thereby doubling community impact.
Transparent Reporting and Accountability:
Instituting a transparent reporting framework to chronicle weekly progress on KLIMA acquisition, carbon asset burn, and community-driven carbon reduction, ensuring accountability and engagement.
Impact Assessment:
Conduct a comprehensive impact assessment post-initiative to quantify the economic impact on $KLIMA , carbon inventory, and community engagement outcomes, thus informing future strategic initiatives.
The Presents for the Planet initiative is a stride towards amplifying on-chain carbon retirement, thereby enhancing the KlimaDAO ecosystem's economic and environmental footprint. It extends a call to the community to transition to active participants in the global carbon reduction narrative.
Your endorsement is a significant leap towards a carbon-conscious and economically robust KlimaDAO ecosystem.

KIP-57: BCT Transition,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xcef69824ff641a9a0951e6de77e2eda724efb335372e98f72e2f7d40fc3fb01b,"Summary
This proposal outlines the transition of governance of the Base Carbon Tonne (BCT) from Toucan Protocol to KlimaDAO. The transition includes the transfer of administrative control of BCT carbon pool smart contracts and the rebranding of BCT tokens.
Motivation
The transfer of BCT governance to KlimaDAO is a strategic move to consolidate our position in the carbon credit market. This transition enables us to have direct control over a significant environmental asset, further aligning with our mission of driving ecological action. This consolidation is anticipated to enhance the ability of KlimaDAO to manage underlying carbon projects within BCT.
Proposal
Transfer of Control: Transfer administrative control of the BCT carbon pool from Toucan to KlimaDAO, encompassing smart contracts on both Main net (Polygon, Celo) and Test net (Mumbai, Alfajores).
Rebranding of BCT Token: Develop a new visual logo for the BCT token, removing the designation ""Toucan Protocol"" from all contracts and documents.
Payment for Transfer: KlimaDAO will pay 125,000 USDC to Toucan Protocol in exchange for administrative control of BCT.
Governance Approval: Implement this transition in compliance with the KlimaDAO Governance Framework, requiring a final vote of approval from the KlimaDAO community.
BCT Management: BCT was developed for the launch of KlimaDAO, and henceforth will be managed and owned by KlimaDAO. Upon passing of this proposal, the DAO wallet will be whitelisted for 0% selective redemption fees, and the protocol team will have the authority to manage the underlying TCO2’s at its discretion.

The proposal is for KlimaDAO to secure 3,000 tonnes of pre-CORCs from Sky East Invest LTD for delivery in 2025 at $250,000. Sky East Invest LTD, an innovative green energy provider and creator of Easychar, allows for sustainable carbon capture in existing energy consuming businesses, offering a scalable decarbonization solution.
Motivation
This acquisition aligns with KlimaDAO’s strategic initiatives to invest in scalable, high-impact carbon capture technologies. The Easychar model, with live distilleries and capacity for significant annual carbon sequestration, provides a dual benefit of reducing carbon footprint and supplying renewable energy. The investment in pre-CORCs underpins KlimaDAO's commitment to forward-thinking environmental stewardship and supports the protocol by diversifying its portfolio into tangible, impact-driven assets.
Proposal
Secure Purchase: Finalize the purchase of 3,000 tonnes of pre-CORCs from Sky East Invest LTD for $250,000, at $83.33 / pre-CORC, ensuring the addition of high-quality carbon to KlimaDAO's asset base.
VERPA: Enter into a voluntary emissions reduction purchase agreement (VERPA) with Sky East Invest LTD at the agreed upon terms.
Strategic Partnership: Leverage the relationship with Sky East Invest LTD to explore further synergies in green energy, carbon capture, and scalable biochar initiatives.
On-chain liquidity: Use the pre-CORCs, either prior to delivery or afterwards, to create a liquid biochar market traded against $KLIMA
Financial Structuring: Align payment schedules and terms with KlimaDAO’s treasury management and Green Ratio guidelines.
Future Scaling: Assess Sky East Invest LTD’s expansion plans for additional investments and partnership opportunities, in line with the Carbon Evaluation Framework, supporting KlimaDAO's scaling objectives.
Sky East Invest LTD offers tangible benefits to distilleries in which their boilers are installed, creating a symbiotic and scalable process for carbon sequestration.
Sky East Invest LTD has completed lifecycle assessments (LCA’s) of both current installations (Bladnoch / Tamdhu), as well as for the second (Deanston and Glen Grant) and third waves (GlenDronach) of installations.
Bladnoch LCA
Tamdhu LCA
This purchase represents an opportunity for KlimaDAO to diversify its treasury into a high-impact asset class and make new environmental asset markets with this supply. This represents a highly symbiotic opportunity, and I encourage all community members to learn more about Sky East Invest LTD Easychar solution and engage with this proposal.

This proposal seeks to empower KlimaDAO's protocol team to more efficiently manage carbon assets.
Motivation
Currently, KlimaDAO is not able to select the price that it sells carbon for. The price of liquidity pools controls the market rate of underlying carbon projects, creating an inefficiency for the DAO. There are carbon projects that could be listed at higher prices than the pool price, while maintaining all essential pool infrastructure and liquidity. This can be solved by creating a listing manager contract that is managed by KlimaDAO.
The creation of a listing manager contract underpins the drive for efficient and dynamic management of KlimaDAO's carbon assets. This move will enable the protocol team to react swiftly to market opportunities and ensure strategic placement of carbon credits across various exchanges. The allocated funds for digital carbon purchases will enhance KlimaDAO's market presence and influence while supporting the broader carbon market ecosystem.
Proposal
Listing Manager Contract: Establish a contract to manage and list KlimaDAO's un-pooled carbon tonnes.
Discretionary Management: Grant the protocol team discretionary authority to manage assets in the listing manager contract, subject to a 2/3 multisig for a harmonization of efficiency and security.
The 3 members on the listing manager multisig will be determined by existing protocol team membership and be ratified by the protocol team via a majority vote.
This proposition paves the way for agile, informed, and secure carbon asset management within KlimaDAO, leveraging our team's expertise to enhance the protocol's operational efficiency and market engagement.

This proposal recommends KlimaDAO's origination of the ""Hygiene and Environmental Care for Tanks and Overhead Reservoirs (HECTOR)"" carbon project, ensuring alignment with our strategic investment objectives and the newly introduced Green Ratio financial management framework.
Motivation
The undertaking of the HECTOR project aligns with KlimaDAO's strategic goals and the Green Ratio's guidance. This project will not only yield verifiable environmental benefits and carbon credits but also enhance our operational efficiency by optimizing the deployment of our USDC reserves, thus maximizing our potential for impact and contributing to our strategic reserves in compliance with the Green Ratio.
The original proposal, viewed here, has been materially modified to reduce the capital expenditure required by KlimaDAO to secure the scaling of the HECTOR project while maintaining Klima’s place on the Project Design Document (PDD).
The first offtake agreement from this project, passed in December, will be considered void and a part of this new deal structure.
By integrating this project into our portfolio, we optimize capital allocation, maximize our impact, continue to move KlimaDAO closer to project development, while adhering to the Green Ratio.
Proposal
KlimaDAO will enter into a 5-year offtake agreement with the following detailed financial commitments:
Purchase Price over time:
Vintage 2023 – US $14.75
Vintage 2024 - US $15.25

Vintage 2027 - US $16.75
This represents a firm commitment of:
Year 1: 27,000 VERs * 14.75 = $398,250
Year 2: 27,000 VERs * 15.25 = $411,750
Firm commitment = $810,000
With year 3:

How does this impact KlimaDAO?
Embarking on the origination of a high-impact project like HECTOR offers multifaceted benefits to KlimaDAO that extend well into the coming decade. The benefits permeate through various layers of the organization, from enhancing monetary value to amplifying public relations and marketing impact, as well as demonstrating our capacity to effectively manage and deploy larger pools of capital. Here are some key benefits:
Accelerating Impact Investments: The direct origination of a carbon credit project such as HECTOR allows KlimaDAO to be at the forefront of the carbon credit supply chain, potentially increasing the economic value captured. By originating the project from the ground up, KlimaDAO can optimize cost efficiencies and enjoy the full breadth of financial benefits from the sale of credits in the voluntary carbon market, which often command premium prices due to their verified impact.
Public Relations and Brand Image: By spearheading a project that provides tangible benefits in terms of clean water and sanitation, KlimaDAO positions itself as a leader in environmental impact, enhancing its reputation. The project's alignment with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals showcases KlimaDAO's commitment to global priorities, earning goodwill and respect from the broader public, stakeholders, and potential partners.
Marketing Leverage: Projects provide compelling narratives for marketing campaigns. Success stories from HECTOR can be utilized to illustrate KlimaDAO's direct involvement in creating a positive environmental impact. These stories resonate with both the crypto community and the general public, raising awareness of KlimaDAO's brand and attracting new participants to the platform.
Scaling Traction: Managing a project of HECTOR's scale demonstrates KlimaDAO's capability to effectively deploy larger capital allocations and handle complex projects. This proven track record can attract larger investors and partners, looking for capable platforms to manage significant environmental projects. It also sets a precedent for scaling up operations and can pave the way for KlimaDAO to undertake even more ambitious projects in the future.
Operational Excellence: Having a project under its wing compels KlimaDAO to hone its project management, monitoring, and reporting skills. This operational experience is invaluable and can be leveraged to streamline future projects, making KlimaDAO a more attractive proposition for project developers and contributors who are seeking efficiency and reliability.
Community Engagement and Governance: Engaging the KlimaDAO community in the governance of a project fosters a deeper sense of participation and investment in the DAO's success. It can lead to increased voter turnout, more lively discussions in governance forums, and a stronger, more cohesive community.
Conclusion:
The origination of the HECTOR project is not just a strategic impact investment for KlimaDAO; it's a catalyst for growth and a beacon for environmental and social governance. It enhances our monetary foundation in line with the Green Ratio. Cash outlay aligns with the 22% allocation for Forward Carbon Agreements, considering the current asset distribution, the $425,000 down payment allows ample room for future purchases, and the $810,000 firm will deplete just over half of the capital KlimaDAO is to deploy into forward carbon this year.
Brokering VCS3425 at a profit and using the proceeds to fund this project indicates KlimaDAO’s ability to manage forward assets and source favorable deal flow.
Originating this project elevates KlimaDAO's public profile, enriches our marketing narratives, demonstrates our scalability, refines our operational capabilities, unlocks a high quality stream of carbon credits, and invigorates our community.
These comprehensive benefits are instrumental in moving KlimaDAO closer to project development, creating more on chain supply, and establishing it as a prudent champion of environmental action.

This proposal outlines a strategic initiative to expand KlimaDAO’s environmental commodities market on Base.
Motivation
KlimaDAO has built a suite of tools and amassed a treasury on Polygon capable of supporting multiple EVM chains.
Klima Data
Retirement Aggregator
Retirement Bonds
$KLIMA
Treasury Wallet, DAO Wallet
We now will be offering users the ability to retire carbon from any chain using Circle's USDC via a cross-chain retirement tool (powered by Axelar cross-chain function calls https://axelar.network/blog/cross-chain-function-calls-will-replace-bridges), removing any need for $KLIMA or carbon liquidity on the source chain. The first chain this tool will be deployed to is Base.
Retirement functionality is one aspect of an environmental commodities market, but without $KLIMA on the source chain users are limited in how they can interact with our ecosystem. With the rapid growth of new users to Base (seen above), the continued onboarding of family offices and institutions via initiatives like Project Diamond by Coinbase & Coinbase Asset Management, and the regulatory clarity and skill exemplified by the Coinbase Legal and Policy teams - make Base an ideal destination for expansion of KlimaDAO’s environmental commodity infrastructure.
Proposal
Introduce cross-chain retirement functionality to Base, accessible with USDC or KLIMA via a soon-to-be-developed frontend similar to https://app.klimadao.finance/#/offset. (Axelar backend contracts are already complete)
Expand $KLIMA liquidity to Base and seed a KLIMA/wETH liquidity pool.
Implementation
Purchase 100 ETH using USDC from the KlimaDAO Treasury
Create a new multisig on Base managed by the same signers as the current DAO wallet on Polygon
Deploy $KLIMA as an interchain token using a cross-chain token service like Axelar's Interchain Token Service: https://axelar.network/interchaintokens
Bridge an equivalent value of KLIMA & 100 ETH to Base, depositing in KlimaDAO’s new Base multi-sig
Deploy KLIMA/WETH liquidity on Base
Deploy cross-chain version of the https://app.klimadao.finance/#/offset frontend
Enable cross-chain retirements from Base
Conclusion
The proposed expansion of KlimaDAO onto Base represents a strategic move to leverage the protocol for broader impact on one of the fastest growing blockchain ecosystems. By establishing a presence on Base, KlimaDAO aims to enhance the liquidity, accessibility, and utility of environmental commodities, aligning with our mission to drive meaningful action against climate change. This initiative promises to extend our reach, enabling more users to participate in the carbon market and contribute to global sustainability efforts.

KIP-63: Aerodrome - KLIMA/WETH POL Management,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x10bb577e79ebb737e0de5cf9dcc5de2f950fd99a054cbf1a1762b1d51a3dd5e3,"Summary
We propose to deploy a $0.75m KLIMA/wETH Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) to Aerodrome on Base by migrating a portion of our existing Polygon KLIMA/BCT LP and procuring 100 ETH from the treasury using USDC, as outlined here.
Aerodrome allows liquidity pools to attract 3-4x as much value in AERO tokens as they collect in trading fees and protocol incentives.
As a result the DAO could collect $3+ in AERO rewards directed to a KLIMA/wETH pool for every $1 it deploys in incentives. The KlimaDAO community will benefit from attractive APRs, increased trading volumes, deep liquidity, and access to the Base DeFi community. The position will also provide a veAERO vote share, allowing the DAO to direct AERO emissions for potential future migration of carbon pools to Base as well as potential liquidity rewards for carbon liquidity providers, and in time may allow the DAO to provide LP deployment/veAero votes as a service to other protocols launching tokens.
Motivation
Our current Polygon KLIMA/BCT LP is valued at $2m and has generated insignificant volumes and fees, with $26k of volume on $2mn in liquidity and roughly $78/revenue/day.
In spite of the strong price action, liquidity and volume for KLIMA are still relatively muted. There is an opportunity for the DAO to be an early mover and capture a larger portion of market share, which in turn should help bring volume and activity to Base - this is even more relevant given the future potential migration of the majority of KlimaDAO activity to Base.
Aerodrome is the central trading and liquidity marketplace on Base with more than 2x the TVL of all other DEXs on Base combined. AERO emissions are streamed to liquidity pools weekly based on the number of votes received during the weekly voting period (“epoch”). Voters (veAERO holders) receive 100% of fees & incentives for the pools they vote on. Voter rewards typically generate 3-4x the value to LPs. In other words, for every $1 in voter rewards, $3-4 worth of AERO emissions get streamed to LPs.
Projects and their communities can deposit incentives to attract votes/use their own veAERO votepower to direct emissions to their liquidity pools. Every listed project on Aerodrome is eligible to receive veAERO airdrops to help them build Project Owned Votepower passively and benefit from fees and any incentives by voting for their own pool/s. These airdrops are distributed to partners proportional to their contribution across three categories every four weeks. More details about the program here 4.
KlimaDAO is uniquely positioned to benefit from the 3-4x multiplier on top of base fees, as it already owns $1M of KLIMA/USDC liquidity on Polygon whilst also owning 700k+ KLIMA tokens. The DAO can also leverage Relay, Aerodrome’s veAERO automation layer, to vote for KLIMA/wETH perpetually, compound veAERO rewards, and direct AERO emissions to KlimaDAOs POL at zero cost to the DAO. This will grow its share of rewards received over time without adding extra operational overhead.
Specification
Remove $1.4m of liquidity from the existing Sushiswap KLIMA/BCT
Remove a $1.4m portion of the current LP for migration to Base. As KLIMA/BCT has become the largest LP owned by the DAO, KLIMA tokens can be repurposed for other pools that will create more volumes and fees.
Deploy a new KLIMA/wETH LP of $0.75m on Aerodrome
Bridge 100 ETH and a corresponding amount of KLIMA to base for deployment on Aerodrome.
Allocate up to 200k KLIMA tokens ($0.5m value) as incentives over 20 weeks
Funds will need to be set aside for equal weekly distribution as voter incentives over 10 weeks. The DAO should receive the $ value of these funds back in AERO rewards at a greater than 3x multiple.
Compound an equal portion of AERO rewards into more KLIMA/wETH POL
In order to ensure zero net cost of the KLIMA incentives, $25K weekly worth of the AERO received will be converted into more KLIMA/wETH POL.
Lock all portion of remaining AERO rewards to build veAERO votepower
In order to build a position in AERO to direct rewards to the new KLIMA/wETH LP and any future carbon LPs, the remaining AERO should be locked to build veAERO votepower and qualify for Flight School rewards. The Protocol Team will monitor and determine the best utilisation of AERO rewards.
Deposit veAERO into Relay to automate veAERO management
As noted above, the DAO can also leverage Relay to vote for KLIMA/wETH perpetually, compound veAERO rewards, and direct AERO emissions to KlimaDAO POL at zero cost to the DAO.
Assumptions
Expected ROI on deploying position
The total value of AERO emissions last epoch was $5.9m and total rewards (fees and bribes) was $985k, which divided together is a 6x multiplier (i.e. for every $1 in voter rewards, $6 of value was directed to LPs). A 3x multiplier has been used to account for efficiency reduction over the 10 week program.
$25k of KLIMA incentives per week should generate $75K worth of AERO emissions (at the 3x multiplier) distributed to the pool each epoch, which is $3.9m annualised.
By compounding $25K worth of AERO into KLIMA/wETH the DAO will be capturing its weekly earnings whilst growing its POL position on Base and creating a net nil loss from incentives.
Any remaining AERO estimated at $25-50K per week can then go into building KlimaDAO votepower so it can vote for its own pool and claim voter rewards (fees & incentives) every week.
Proposal
We recommend the DAO approves the creation of a $0.75m KLIMA/wETH POL position on Aerodrome, distributing up to $0.5m of incentives in KLIMA over a period of 20 weeks, with incentives calibrated by the protocol team based on realized performance. We also recommend that an amount of AERO equivalent to the incentive value is compounded into additional KLIMA/wETH POL, and the remainder of the AERO is votelocked to build a veAERO position.
Rationale
We stand to increase our impact with earnings on Protocol Owned Liquidity
The DAO should earn $20k+ per week from KLIMA/wETH liquidity with only $750K in liquidity i.e. a 2.7% weekly return. Compared to $400-500 earnings per week on $2M in liquidity i.e. a 0.025% weekly return. This excludes weekly earnings made by the end of the program through its veAERO votepower.
The deployment should Boost APRs and deepen liquidity on Ethereum L2s
AERO emissions will attract additional liquidity providers for KLIMA/wETH, likely bolstering liquidity and trading volumes on Base.
A successful trial can mean rolling out Carbon liquidity to Base in a similar manner
Base is the fastest growing L2 network and a potential leader in onboarding new users to the ETH ecosystem this cycle. Developing a stronger presence on Base will allow KlimaDAO to service the growing Base community and KlimaDAO votepower can be used to direct emissions to a future Carbon pools post-migration to Base.
The DAO’s veAERO position will be a tool to use in future to support other projects
The DAO’s veAERO position will provide a vote share base for an intended migration of carbon pools to Base and potential liquidity rewards for carbon liquidity providers as noted above, but in time may also allow the DAO to provide LP deployment/veAero votes as a service to other protocols launching tokens.
The move will improve KlimaDAO exposure and strengthen its brand
Aerodrome offers all partners support via amplifying relevant comms. As the largest and most ecosystem aligned DEX used by some of the biggest L2 power users in DeFi and trusted by Coinbase Ventures, a close partnership with Aerodrome gives projects a natural boost in exposure and branding. We would have first mover advantage as KLIMA/wETH is not yet whitelisted on the platform and the team wants to work with us directly.
Timeline
Within one week of this proposal passing.
Costs
$0.5m worth of KLIMA tokens will be used as incentives throughout the program (200k KLIMA at current prices) but will be offset by the returns generated in AERO.

KIP-64: Expanding $CHAR,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x5bf02c5f4519eb00c6d1bdd4a6316e42b8bf3e7ed318902593e3bdcd6d7225da,"Summary
This proposal aims to expand KlimaDAO's footprint in the Voluntary Carbon Market by increasing the supply of $CHAR tokens through strategic partnerships and market operations. We propose to be a liquidity partner with Toucan to introduce $CHAR to the Base ecosystem, facilitating liquidity and enhancing market accessibility. Additionally, KlimaDAO seeks to enter into a forward purchase agreement with Exomad Green, the project developer of Concepcion 1, already whitelisted for deposit to $CHAR, to secure additional supply.
Motivation
The Voluntary Carbon Market is experiencing unprecedented demand, with significant implications for carbon pricing and availability. KlimaDAO must seize this opportunity to strengthen its position and influence within this rapidly evolving space. By partnering with Toucan, KlimaDAO will leverage Toucan's robust curation abilities and market presence to enhance the liquidity and availability of biochar via $CHAR liquidity. This will not only augment KlimaDAO's market operations but also accelerate the tokenization of environmental commodities.
Furthermore, entering a forward purchase agreement with Exomad aligns with KlimaDAO's strategic goal to secure long-term, cost-effective carbon credits. Exomad’s Concepcion-1 project is a proven and reliable source of high-quality biochar supply. By securing a supply of 2500 CORCs at a competitive rate, KlimaDAO will improve its market positioning, guarantee supply chain integrity, and support sustainable project development in critical regions.
Proposal
Liquidity Partner with Toucan:
Expand $CHAR to Base. Enhance liquidity and market exposure.
KlimaDAO will work with Toucan to secure and create a liquid market on Base for at least 250 $CHAR, ideally 500 $CHAR, to be paired with $KLIMA.
$CHAR will be sourced at a market rate of $160 per $CHAR
Minimum cost: $40,000 ; Maximum cost: $80,000
Forward Purchase Agreement with Exomad:
Secure a predictable and cost-effective supply of CORCs from the Concepcion-1 project.

KIP-65: Klima 2.0 - Metamorphosis,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xb7883f386dddcd86fb6b7760a096301337603d91046abc157d982e752796e2e8,"Summary
This proposal is a landmark moment for Klima DAO. Tokenized carbon and the usage of blockchain technology provide the foundation for advancing climate finance, and this economic and legal framework positions KlimaDAO to efficiently scale and accelerate its activities.
Our initial foray into this market showcased how carbon pools can partially solve nonfungibility, but they are imperfect and result in capital constraints which limits scale, and inherent fragmentation between carbon classes.
The new economic model under development removes the need for carbon liquidity pools and price oracles for independent carbon classes. Furthermore, it codifies specific aspects of governance in new staking mechanisms.
The associated movement of the DAO’s legal entity to a Swiss Foundation with an accountable Executive Team reduces the operational burdens at the DAO.
Together with our strong community, innovative tech stack, and consistent innovation - we can accelerate the velocity of high integrity environmental markets and our transition to a sustainable future.

KIP 48: J-Credit pilot activity support & J-Credit integration,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0xef8f795eac0833c247c4fb1ed0dac5015e45cff3ad549ca3811c86e5fef99794,"Summary
To promote KlimaDAO's vision of providing the transparent, neutral, and public infrastructure necessary to accelerate climate finance on a global scale, we will begin a pilot for J-Credits in Japan.
About J-Credits
Under the J-Credit Scheme, the Japanese government certifies the amount of greenhouse gas emissions (such as CO2) reduced or removed by sinks through efforts to introduce energy-saving devices and manage forests, as ""credit.“
This scheme, which was created by expansively integrating the Domestic Credit Scheme and the Offset Credit (J-VER; Japan's verified emissions reduction) Scheme, is administered by the central government.
Credits created under the scheme can be used for various purposes, such as achieving the targets of the Nippon Keidanren's Commitment to a Low Carbon Society, and carbon offset.
Partnership & Actions
Pilot Activities
Core Activities
Utilize MORI-NFT’s J-Credit registry account to hold credits during a pilot.
A ‘digital twin’ of held credits will be created via C3’s infrastructure.
Tests will be conducted related to: 1) retirement on-chain; 2) API communication with MORI-NFT for reflecting retirements in their J-Credit account; 3) auditing of MORI-NFT’s J-Credit account (and exploring automations for this purpose); 4) Pooling and J-Credit pool design.
The core infrastructure developed via this pilot will allow other entities holding J-Credits to tokenize them and utilize them across KlimaDAO’s infrastructure (importantly, they will be able to list these credits for sale via Carbonmark).
Ancillary Opportunities
Utilize an SPV for creating a bankruptcy protected custodial entity for J-Credits. This aligns with the current structure for 2-way bridging that C3 is pursuing.
Hosting J-Credits on a 3rd party platform, such as Carbonmark, for retirement there.
Capital requirements
We request 35,000 USDC to fund the onboarding around 1,000 J-Credits from the absorption/carbon removal class.
These credits will be sold via CM to Mori’s existing corporate clients.
J-Credit sales via CM will include a 4% fee (in KLIMA) that will be automatically sent to the KlimaDAO DAO wallet.
NOTE: this KIP does not grant permission for the KlimaDAO treasury to bond or provide liquidity for J-Credits. Such actions would require a subsequent KIP.

KIP 7: KLIMA Moss Liquidity Collaboration,https://snapshot.box/#/s:klimadao.eth/proposal/0x7359c09b24ed01eec218f03c1aa51b6efef4fbd9e454a5acb505fa36c559512b,"Summary
Allow the DAO to pair $500k in KLIMA with $500k in MCO2 to seed a $1m dollar KLIMA/MCO2 liquidity pool. Allow policy to add KLIMA/MCO2 bonds in the future.
Proposal
This proposal is a continuation of KIP-6: Introduce Moss Bonds. Moss would like to provide $500,000 worth of MCO2 tokens to Polygon to pair with $500,000 of KLMA from the DAO to form a liquidity pool. This will be shared between MOSS and the Klima protocol, and be held by Klima protocol for a 6 month time period.
In the future, given enough demand, we request that the community allow the policy team to add KLIMA/MCO2 LP as an bondable asset as well. The MOSS bonds will serve as a gauge to determine the overall demand of the MCO2 token on polygon.
